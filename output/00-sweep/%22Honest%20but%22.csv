"g3ewusr","First of all, I teach English to kids exactly your age, and I'm very impressed with how self aware and articulate you are. Beautifully written! Since the 8th and 9th grade kiddos are especially precious to me, I have lots of advice. Take it all with a grain of salt. You will ultimately know what's best for you. 

I see kids struggle with this stuff all the time, and it can definitely take a toll on your mental health if you try to hide what you really think. But it can also damage relationships if you speak your mind. There's no good answer. The young people I know who are allowed to freely be themselves with parental support are generally the healthiest and happiest. Sometimes you have zero control over this. In so glad you feel healthy so far! 

Figure out what your core values are. This should be separate from anything church related. You can take an online quiz if you're not sure, or just meditate on what is most important to you. Things like honesty, truth, loyalty, etc. Use those values to steer you instead of church doctrine or commandments. Stick to them no matter what. And when they dovetail with church principles, make sure to let your family know you believe strongly in those things. 

I don't know where you live, but if you're in an area where there are a lot of Mormons, the peer pressure can be pretty weighty. Do you have friends that will support you if you tell them the truth about your doubts? If you're not positive, make sure before saying anything. Test the waters before ""coming out"" to them. Chances are pretty good they have doubts too, but you never know how anyone will react when they're feeling scared. 

I'm assuming your parents are reasonable and love you more than anything. At home, if you can be as honest as possible with your mom without hurting her, it might be best to continue to go along with the family observances, but if you can, gently plant some seeds that will allow you to step back a little. Share your true feelings, but try to use language she will relate to. Ask to be excused from family prayer for a while as you figure out your relationship with God, for example. Depending on how chill they are with your situation, ask to skip church sometimes in lieu of another productive activity. Maybe you can provide service as a firm of worship. 

Be sincere and honest, but consider family members who have been taught that a child leaving is the worst thing ever. They will blame themselves, which can affect clarity. Give them time as you take time.

If you continue to take seminary, use your time there to generate and ask thoughtful, respectful questions. Don't make class time a forum for your soap box though. If you don't get a satisfactory answer in class, drop it and speak with your teacher or another adult outside of class. 

Many people find they are happy in the church as non-orthodox believers. If this is something you can find a way to live with, make a place for yourself until you're old enough to decide whether or not you want to leave. 

Most of us feel angry from time to time. You've probably seen that here. We are angry about a lot of things: what the church has taken from us and because often family members won't listen to us. That's normal. Don't suppress it. Don't let it make you bitter or rage at the wrong people. (Venting is always welcome here.) If you can't control this, it might be wise to step back from some of your questions for a while and just ride the wave. 

I feel for you and wish you the very best as you navigate this. It's difficult for each of us in different ways. Know that you have many supportive people here that will answer questions and lend an ear any time.",1598831457,"be sincere and honest, but consider family members who have been taught that a child leaving is the worst thing ever.","sincere and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"sincere and honest","sincere",NA,NA,0
"g3ejo00","I'm white, and very sympathetic to the movement. I do NOT want more black people to die at the hands of police. I think there are good cops, too and they need to stand up and speak out. 

My heart hurts because I saw Lorenzo get hurt during the protest in East Liberty. I think he's in a lot of turmoil over what he's been through. No wonder he's angry. 

I think his heart is in the right place but I think he has some stuff to work through. He's been victimized by the system. He's pissed as hell and he wants everybody to see that. He's entitled to that. I do worry about the movement, though. 

I think that movements that keep their message and their purpose first and foremost out front are effective. Lorenzo lets us know he's angry and gets lots of attention but it doesn't convey the message well. I think the organizers have done a tremendous job. I worry a lot for Lorenzo. There's a place for him there. He can support the movement! At East Liberty, I appreciated his documentation... It was amazing! When he started injecting himself into the documentation, things got fuzzy and emotional and I felt things started going south for him and I grew more and more concerned for him, for his safety and for his well-being. 

I want him to stay safe, to stay healthy, to stay a part of the movement. I can't begin to imagine what it was like to be hurt the way he was, and to feel all he's felt and I'm asking anyone on this thread to think about that. He was hit in the throat with a rubber bullet, left to lay there for who knows how long until someone found him (I don't know), and when someone got him to the hospital but he got arrested... for being at the protest... Since then, it seems like cops have hounded him. 

Well, maybe he feels like if he's going to get harrassed, he'll give them something to harrass him over. I'll tell you, though, he was afraid to go get care at the hospital when he needed it because cops were hanging out around his house, keeping an eye on him. 

So, who knows what all he's been through? I'd ask folks to think things over, because if any of what I've said is unfamiliar then you don't know much. I don't know anything about him before what I watched at East Liberty, to be honest but bottom line is I want him to stay safe... he's already been hurt before.",1598824643,"i don't know anything about him before what i watched at east liberty, to be honest but bottom line is i want him to stay safe... he's already been hurt before.","honest but bottom","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but bottom","bottom",NA,NA,1

"g232j2a","This is a great write-up! You allude to, but don't explicitly say it, but it's not enough to have contrasts or nothing happening being scary--those elements work b/c the rest of the story serves those ends. Without the setup and the context of the rest of the film up to that moment, the moment can't land.

And I'd argue that scene in the basement works particularly well b/c filmgoers understand the language of cinema--they were primed to expect something to happen. Nothing happening was precisely the unexpected thing to occur. As a result, the film's tension doesn't release, the way it would if there was a jump scare or if the killer revealed himself and had a fight with Graysmith. Thus, it retains control of your emotions, giving it additional power as it continues in the telling of the story.

So, perhaps one takeaway is that as writer, you should write to manipulate the audience's emotions. Not to be disingenuous, but to be honest but surprising, to control the flow of information to the story's needs, not the audience's. Do it well, and they'll appreciate the work you did to make them feel the things they felt in that moment, the same way we're doing with Fincher's Zodiac.",1597829305,"not to be disingenuous, but to be honest but surprising, to control the flow of information to the story's needs, not the audience's.","honest but surprising","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but surprising","surprising",NA,NA,1

"g21w7j0","Hey! Thanks for sharing your story. I know it's scary to put your writing out there to be critiqued, so I hope that these notes don't come across as too harsh. I'm going to be honest but thoughtful, and hopefully I can be of some help.

With that said, let's get started...

**Characters:**

Ideally, you want to immediately anchor the reader in the pov of your main character. Considering that the cyclist is your main character, it’s confusing to me why you begin the story in the cafe and introduce the cyclist through a random customer’s pov. It’s a lot of unnecessary work for the reader. Why spend so much time building the cafe setting when it’s immediately dropped and fails to pay off in any way?

I tried caring about your main character in the beginning, but it just never got there for me. By the time I got through the second page (probably five-hundred words), I was still looking for a single reason to care about him. This is something you have to consider when writing your story: Why should the reader care about this guy? Ways to accomplish this would be to either a.) Show us his motivations through unique/interesting action or b.) Give him relatable emotional reactions to whatever is happening to him in the story. I see you attempting the latter by giving us a flashback to the girlfriend, but it falls flat, primarily because the message of the flashback is incredibly confusing. I can’t discern whether he’s happy or sad. Is he remembering this fondly? Or is he torn up over the loss? Your word choice and sentence structure gives us conflicting signals. To show this, I’ve copied the paragraph below. The signals for happy are in **bold**, and I’ve *italicized* what I think signals the opposite. 

“He recalls the first night he’d seen it – **the night of their fourth anniversary.** *She wobbled up to his seat at the patio they always went, horribly late, beaming, almost toppling over, her sandals slipping from the clips.* *He paid no attention to the bike then.* **Her excitement was a thousand bikes.** But later, his closer inspection of the colouring, the custom drivetrain… **she’d perfected it** – all the specifics he recalled **praising in the passion of his racing peak,** *while she read and presented to listen.* **Or, in hindsight, pretended to read and listened in full.**”

As you can see, this is a roller coaster of emotion, and not in a good way. Remember, intrigue is good, confusion is not. Complex emotions can be intriguing, but this reads more like the writer being unsure of what they’re trying to convey. 

The confusion continues when the protagonist makes it to the hospital to see the woman. Ideally, the buildup of this meeting would produce tension. You should give the reader enough information to wonder what will happen once he meets with the woman, foreshadowing the conflict, and then resolve that conflict sometime during their interaction. As of right now, the meeting just kind of happens and the woman is kind of . . . there. We know a little about their backstory, but not a single thing that points us to the possibility of their interaction being the least bit interesting. So my advice would be to build to this scene with intrigue, hinting at a conflict and inevitable resolution. For example, your protagonist has cheated on the woman and he suspects that she has found out. (I know this doesn’t work with your story, this is strictly an example.) Now when your protagonist walks into the room, the reader is latching on to every little action and line of dialogue, trying to find out whether or not this interaction will end in a huge, relationship-ending argument.

Regarding that actual scene, I do think that their interaction is well written in the beginning. There is a nice interplay of action and dialogue that is beautifully done. For example, “ ‘Her face sinks. “That’s it?’ ” That little line is clear action coupled with concise dialogue. From those five words the reader can tell that she’s disappointed, so they understand her better, and like her more. Real human emotions shared by (seemingly) real humans. 

However, this scene does quickly devolve. The brain cancer angle is a bit trite, imo. It feels like manufactured drama chiefly because there’s only one way you can approach this (that it’s the saddest thing ever) and that’s the route you choose. Readers want to be surprised. And they can smell this one coming from a mile away. Try coming up with a more unique scenario to put your characters through, and see where that takes you. Keep pushing until the characters actions surprise you. Because if your characters aren’t surprising you, then they definitely aren’t surprising the reader.

**Prose:**

Consider the information you’re giving the audience and the order in which you’re giving it. The beginning of the story introduces many different elements about the cyclist (his new suit, his job, etc.) yet, instead of providing payoffs for these set-ups, you instead move on to his prior relationship. This results in your story feeling scattered. My advice would be to know the story that you’re telling, and then tell it as clearly and directly as possible. There’s nothing wrong with a rich, complex story, but the reader is going to lose their faith in you if they feel they’re being given too many balls to juggle without any reward.

At times it certainly feels like you’re guilty of overwriting. What that means is that at points in the story it seemed as if your focus was on making the sentences fancy and poetic instead of clear and simple. I think this usually stems from a writer that’s trying to accomplish too much in single sentences. In my opinion, the best writing is a product of simple sentences that accumulate to form a beautiful structure. Think of your sentences as bricks that will ultimately build a house. In a vacuum, your sentences should read as serviceable, not extravagant. If you take this simple, workmanlike approach, I believe that your sentences will build a house that's greater than the sum of its parts.",1597798536,"i'm going to be honest but thoughtful, and hopefully i can be of some help.","honest but thoughtful","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but thoughtful","thoughtful",NA,NA,1
"g21rd14","So... two things. One you’ll probably be ok with and one you won’t like. 

First - just be honest and open with them. However poorly they take the honesty it’s way better than how they’ll react when (not if) they learn you were dishonest. They’re going to find out you’re moving in with your boyfriend, and they may be upset if you’re open and honest, but they’ll definitely be hurt and angry if you’re not the one who tells them. 
There are ways to have that conversation.. just open with:

 “hey I need to talk to you all about some big life decisions. You guys have been amazing and have helped me so much and I know I haven’t taken time to really thank you for everything you’ve done. I also know there’s been a decent amount of friction because of lifestyle, and before that turns into something that sours how we all feel about each other, and because I’ve started to get my life sorted out, I feel like now is a good time to try to do this on my own, without having to completely depend on your generosity. Also, you’re not going to approve, but I love you all and I hope you’ll support me anyways, but I’m not asking permission: I’ve decided to give moving in with my boyfriend a shot. If it doesn’t work out I’ll get my own place, but I want to see where this goes.”

They’ll either be supportive or they won’t.. but it was always going to be that way no matter what.  Don’t talk about how you don’t like their morals or lifestyle - this is about you starting your life, not you trying to escape them. 

Now...the other part. You love your boyfriend, I get it. But if everyone you know is sour on him maybe you need to take a step back and ask yourself what’s going on. What do they see that you don’t, and are you making excuses for him. I don’t know...there’s no way for me to know...but you know your own mind, and you know whether you’re hiding stuff from yourself. Before you go tying your finances, living situation, and immediate future to a guy none of the other people in your life approve of, just do yourself the favor of asking yourself some really difficult questions and being honest about the answers. Could you make this move on your own? Doing it on your own, even if it’s a little more of a struggle, is empowering, and if things continue to be good with you both maybe you guys talk about moving in together later. 

In the end, you know your own mind here, and no advice going against what you’ve set your mind to will have any meaningful effect. I’m just asking you to really give that little voice in the back of your head, the one that tells us when something is off, a chance to speak up if it needs to. 

Good luck. Love you kiddo. Come update us on how it goes, because I really hope they’re supportive and don’t cut ties with you over it all...but if they do just know it was only a matter of time before some decision you made didn’t sit well with them and you’d end up here anyways.

Edit: also, consider you don’t need to have something to “show” when you enlist... you just enlist...and if enlisting is truly your plan then moving in with someone will make that decision more complicated when the time comes.  The Air Force is a good choice....maybe consider just jumping in with both feet there, if you don’t have a solid reason for waiting.",1597795861,"first - just be honest and open with them.","honest and open","honest",NA,FALSE,"honest and open","open",NA,NA,1

"g0ph0nl","&gt; This is where your comment get's a little weird to be honest i don't really know if you entirely understand the situation (Which is fair since im also still learning) or at least have even bothered to see what trans people are saying about the word,


As of i was writing that comment, i really dont know. But whatever it is, currently i know the full story of the word. I know the exact hate with the word and i can understand it.  And i really wanted to avoid that post because in all honest but fuck it. 

(after skimming through)

Basically what i already knew.  Trans despise the word because, in assaults and murders with trans women involved, the suspect said that he was tricked  to have sex with them. The whole gay panic attack. 

However there are certain, things that i still dont understand and i beg of you if you can help me understand or something. From the post that you linked,

&gt; . It's an offensive slur rooted in an offensive stereotype that causes real tangible harm and violence. 

How can it cause tangible harm? It feels like, every man they might came across, they will assault them for what they are. Which isnt true. Possible, yeah. 100%? No. So with that in mind, how can they be so damn afraid of it, that they cant stand others having a joke with the word? I mean if we work with this logic, ban whatever is making you feel extremely uncomfortable, we might as well remove, half of the movies and games alike.  So many have lost their parents and grandparents to ww2 and nazis. So many people have lost their loved one in car accidents and shooting (gta if im being vague). And yet, here we are having said games being extremely popular and i can assume, profitable.  

What im trying to say is that lots of peps have things that can very well and for good reason insult them. Yet they dont for a number or reasons. And thats why i believe that trans people are sensitive. They want a word that can in no way shape or form touch them, be banned, from a subreddit dedicated to memes specifically on anime, where the word traps is deeply connected. I know that PTSD is a real thing and some trans to have from a traumatic even, and as such i can expect for even a mere word to proc negative stuff asssociated with PTSD but i highly doubt that the majority of their population has it. It feels from my perspective (again, thats why im asking whats the harm so i can understand) like an overreaction. 

&gt; (your wording of trans people is also kind of weird of calling them a tran but for all i know it's just ignorance)

No its not. Im just too lazy to conciously write trans people every god damn time. Sometimes i type too fast a trans. But in all honesty it shouldnt be something to be offended since its a grammatical (or vocubulary one?) error since transgender is an adjective.",1596824896,"and i really wanted to avoid that post because in all honest but fuck it.

Addressing ‘Pan IIT Global E-Conclave on reimagining MSMEs and Livelihoods’ on Sunday through video conference, the Union Minister said that  most of the population in the country is involved in very small enterprises like fishing, Bee-keeping, Bamboo production etc. and are economically and socially backward and lack sufficient financial support for them.
They are hard working, skilled, talented and honest but due to lack of finance they can not do any value addition in their businesses/works.
With a little financial, technological and marketing support  they can grow their business/work which in turn will definitely boost employment opportunities  in Rural, Agricultural and Tribal areas and will also give strength to our GDP.
Nitin Gadkari invited suggestions to develop a model to help and finance these socially, economically and educationally backward entrepreneurs.
He said that this model should be transparent, corruption free, IT enabled with less procedural hassles and needing least permissions etc.
He expressed hope that the model when approved by NITI Ayog, Finance Ministry, can support a lot of enterprises involved in bamboo, honey production, alternative fuels and other areas.

"fy852if","New therapist is a good idea, but understandably not always attainable. 

Does he know why you struggle to open up? Have you been able to talk about the bad past relationships? 

You say you’ve been trying really hard to be open and honest but don’t feel like it’s enough. Sometimes you don’t notice the progress you’ve made when you’re constantly analyzing your own behaviour. Compared to the beginning have you relaxed more around him? Have you told him things you haven’t told other people before? You may be doing better than you think but the self criticizing doesn’t let you see it, and he may need to be reminded that progress can be slow and non-linear, but so long as there is mindful effort it’s worth continuing with if you’re both invested. You realizing that it’s a good, healthy relationship that you want to work on is already huge and recognizing past toxicity is a good step to avoid making similar mistakes.  

Try to keep him in the loop on your feelings as best you can, and if you’re struggling to open up try and ask about his. Listen to how he scripts his feelings/thoughts and try and mirror the level he opens up and how he talks about it. Even responding to what he says can help phrase how you feel.

"fy81o2m","I really sympathise/empathise. I live with an older relative who is hoarding books that are encroaching everywhere. I love books, and I know it's not a weird thing to hoard compared to some things, but there has to be a balance between living space and 'stuff'. And a parent hoarded in the past when they were ill, to the point I would get yelled at for throwing out soured milk and long expired food.  So I have some experience trying to negotiate this and it can be really emotional. 

If you don't stay firm (kind, but firm), you'll end up having to spend so much time and energy in an emotional and physical battle to get her stuff out as it inevitably builds. 

Maybe you need to have an honest but kind conversation and say that the way you grew up really affected you, that you're ok with it now but that living with unnecessary stuff around makes you anxious and upset. 

Pick truly treasured items out of what she already has together and make lovely displays. Go through some of those old photos together and make a big frame to display for example. In my experience older people are really genuinely attached to physical photos so I don't think they need to go. They also come from an era of make do and mend when things weren't so replaceable or cheap, and hate getting rid of things they think can be useful to someone else, so maybe saying you'll donate the stuff and then just binning it if it's truly junk would be okay. 

Reiterate that it's that having bags of junk and piles of things stored poorly around isn't healthy for either of you. It's also a safety hazard to both of you, especially if her mobility is compromised.

You may feel unkind, being firm and getting rid of useless things, and she may be rude to you about it, but you're honestly doing both of you a favour. Prepare a standard response to when she's being cranky about it, don't reply if you're feeling emotional and make sure any changes you 'enforce' are done in a positive proactive way rather than in anger. 

Hoarding is obviously a sad sign of not being able to cope and maybe you and your Mom could do with some therapy around that too. 

I'm currently in a cardboard box fight - they are needed for donating books (that never get donated and just sit in boxes in her bedroom) apparently, ha!

"fxiqct8","From experience having both Pax3 and Solo2 (essentially a larger Air with non-replaceable larger batteries), my very long and honest but not that humble opinion:

Pax3:
-incredibly “portable” vaporizer. I used to think I lost it all the time because it always disappeared into the darkest corners of my jeans pockets. Had a few scares in other situations for the same reason.
-Perfect for vaping on the move, like hiking, because it’s all self-contained, no mouthpieces to attach or flip or pull or mount
-Sessions can last as long or as short as you want if you play around with the presets, accelerometer-based auto-shutoff timer (if you don’t put it down it can go on and on and on and on...).
-non-replaceable battery... meh
-granular App-Control possible, but the four presets do the job perfectly fine
-Steel airpath, vapor can be harsh and hot but hits like a pan in the face
-Conduction
-Cleaning is a bit of a bitch (for me) due to the narrow airpath (pipecleaners do it) and the not-that-rounded edges of the chamber (*makeup* q-tips - great tip from my wife). Still easier than most vapes though.

Personal Verdict: in this day and age, THE Master of stealth and portability... but not much else. 
I keep it for longer events where stealth is important and pocket space scarce (weddings, funerals, etc). Combined with Budkups it’s the coolest gadget I own. But it’s just that, a “show-off” one-button gadget that still looks like a powerbank and thus does not draw attention by itself. I absolutely love it, it was my first and longest used vape so far, but I wouldn’t buy it again, I would get a Pax2 or Fury for the same practical stealth purposes for significantly less moneys instead.

Air (combining tech facts and my Solo experience):
-assembly required for each session, including mounting a (mouth)piece of *glass*... I’d call that “transportable” but not “portable” xD the tubes *can* be carried safely, but still separate... plus it looks like the bastard child of a microphone and a test tube
-perfect for taking with you to a spot where you *sit down* and vape, or for walking the dog, or taking to a friend’s house...not really for “active-lifestyle” vaping methinks. I have nightmares where I’m vaping on my bike and fall down... you picture the rest.
-auto-shut-off/session timer... meh
-*replaceable* battery (you can take replacements with you)
-granular single-degree temperature adjustment (some like it - I don’t; I would just prefer two presets, one for taste one for cashing, like my crafty can do).
-Glass vapor path OMG TASTY, and hits more like an unbelievably good massage
-Convection (actually hybrid but let’s not go down that road).
-Cleaning is simply throwing the stems/mouthpieces into ISO or warm milk and shake or stir carefully. I have a couple different vapes, and my Arizers are simply the easiest to clean.

Personal Verdict: to me, having the Crafty to compare, Arizers seem like tastier and easier to clean Mighty(Solo) and Crafty(Air), for the same purposes. Taste and clouds for hours. Would buy the Solo buy again, only regret not buying it (or an Air or an ArGo) sooner, because I probably would not have bought some of the others I have :P

I’d say think about what you’re either “looking for” or “missing”:
no-bullshit awesome taste and longevity (Air) or premium portability/stealth and “push and go” practicality (Pax)?

My partner (M25 IFSP) and I (F25 INFJ) were going to a concert last minute(2years ago). He was supposed to go with his dad, but his dad offered me the ticket last minute. We were about to drive his dad’s car, and we were planning to use the indoor parking and we both had no idea how much it was supposed to cost.

ISFP: I think $15 should be enough money

*suspicious INFJ hunch appears*

INFJ: What if it’s more?

ISFP: ~*should be fine*~

INFJ: What if it’s more?

ISFP: Okay i’ll bring $20

*suspicious INFJ hunch disappears*
INFJ: ok.

**Well turns out the cost was exactly $20.**

But I would have accepted any other back up plan. I just see how things could go wrong and need to know that I know what to do if everything goes wrong.

But balance is important here.

Worrying all the time is dangerous for your health. If extra communication, listening to what is on her mind doesn’t seem to be enough, you could ask her how she feels about therapy. It’s just.. if you don’t process stuff over time it can add up, and she probably knows she can’t put all her worries on your shoulders. 

I see a lot of descriptions of INFJ that are really anxious, stressed, about their physical environment, just like the way you describe it, and it just seems like that’s not who she is really is as a person. She needs to relax. She needs alone time, to eat, sleep, and/or maybe therapy if she wants. 

The part about car rides and biking, I can’t really say. I don’t relate. Actually, going on a car ride with my partner (i don’t have a driver’s license) i feel so relaxed after he drives me around. 

But also, any time we spend in nature is the best. The botanical garden, national parks, etc.

Otherwise, other Se activities will get me out of that Ti-Ni loop. It has to be something she is familiar with, it’s not the time to challenge with new activities. Whatever she feels confortable doing wether its cooking, drawing, crafts, meditation, exercise, even cleaning.

And ok last advice, overcommunicate  about how you feel, lead by example, be vulnerable. Be honest but careful use I language when you’re confronting, really avoid using You language. It sounds simple but it transforms relationships.

"fm0fpha","I don't think you are taking this lightly at all, I happen to believe you are being honest and open about this. Hopefully you realise that I am too, and that I am willing to listen.

My only disagreement is that I can't see how we can intuitively know if what someone is saying is true not only because of our own limitations, or that people can be dishonest, but also because people can be mistaken.

I can give you a good example from my teenage years- I remember a funny situation we were in where my friend accidentally set a couch in fire, then slapped it with his hand to put it out. He looked down at the melted mess of his hand and was horrified,  only to be relieved when we pointed out that his skin was not melted, it was simply melted plastic covering his hand. We all laughed and told that story for months. I was telling the story once, only to have the friend that it happened to point out that I wasn't actually there that day. I was stunned, I said ""I sure was, I remember it well"" but then my other friends all agreed that indeed I wasn't there, they even let me know where I was and I realised that they were telling the truth, I was out of town, but had heard the story so many times that my brain had subconsciously created the memory.  I wasn't lying when I said I was there with them, I was being completely honest, but I was simply mistaken. This happens all the time because our memories are inaccurate. 

This is why eye witnesses can falsely identify people even though they are people completely honest, they really do believe that person committed the crime. So it's not only dishonesty we are trying to detect, but also whether or not they are mistaken,  and I don't know how we can intuitively detect that.

So let's take the Prophet Mohammad, perhaps he was
100% honest, is there also some way to know that he was not mistaken about what he is saying? Then we need to find out if his words have been recorded accurately,  which means that the person writing them down must also be both 100% honest, and be infallible, I'm unsure how we can be sure of this.

I am more than willing to listen to the reason why you are sure that this information is trustworthy, I don't know what happened 1500 years ago, and if Islam is true than I absolutely want to know that information, I just see it as being reasonably cautious in what I trust because these are important questions.",1585656354,"i don't think you are taking this lightly at all, i happen to believe you are being honest and open about this.","honest and open","honest",NA,FALSE,"honest and open","open",NA,NA,1

"fm084g0","Lmao I'm reading all of the messages in the comments, some of em really are pathetics...

He didn't tell you because he simply thoughts that it's not of your business, nothing more nothing less. Not trying to be mean here, juste realistic and honest, but just think about it for a second. Is it really a problem ? You saw by yourself that he doesn't entertain the ""flirting"" of that woman, he avoids the subject, but keeps talking to her otherwise. That means one thing : he enjoys talking to that lady. Why should that be an issue ? Why do you believe he has to tell you everything about everyone he's chatting with ? You told it yourself : he's a very talkative man, and you never had issues with it, so why do you make such a bug deal out of it now ? And honestly, would you say that you never talked to men qui te regularly for 8 years ? 

I honestly believe he lied to you when you went to confront him because he didn't want to upset you, he didn't expect you to confront him and was just surprised. He was probably asking himself how you know her and a lot more of questions, so he gave you the quickest answer he could give you, something along the lines of ""I don't really know her, we're just chatting every other day"". From what I could read about him, and according to his reaction, I strongly believe that he's not used to lie, specially not lying to you. If he was, and if he was really cheating with that woman (what you're affraid he's doing), he would have a whole story of lies prepared already, he wouldn't have hesitated, and he just would have lied to you quite smoothly.

I may not be a psychologist, but I've kinda been in his position. The secret is trust. If you trust him, and I bet you do, where's the problem ? 

It's easy to spot a yellow car when you're always thinking about a yellow car, it's easy to spot reasons to be mad when you're always thinking about being mad, and it's equally easy to spot reasons to not trust your bf when you're always thinking that he may be cheating on you. He isn't.

Don't make such a big deal out of it, I can bet she's not the only one he's been chatting with through all these years. Nothing ever happened, and he never told you cause he didn't want to worry you, or he didn't want you to ask questions. There's nothing to be worry about, humans are very social by nature, and you desribed him as ""talkative"" yourself.

The only issue here, from an external point of view is that you discovered it without him telling you. You went through his phone, his personal life, and you saw and admitted that he never flirted with her, he even avoided the subject, and on WhatsApp, if he had deleted some messages, you would have known.

So now, what's really the issue ? You acted nervously because obviously you care about him, and you're affraid of losing him, but you're not. He's only socializing.

Honestly just get it over with. The only real issue I can see here, from my pov, is that he's not really ""taking down"" her flirting. I can understand that this could make you uncomfortable with the situation, and I could agree with you on that. Maybe he doesn't dare for some reason, or thinks that she may stop herself if he's not entertaining it. Or that woman may be quite stubborn.

Don't be mad to him about it. And mostly, do NOT listen to all those comments like ""if he lied once, how can you know that he never lied before ?"" that's total bullshit. I know lying from experience and as my job, and I can tell you that Hé really isn't an usual liar.

Just think about it cold headed. You are making a huge deal out of this. I'm not judging you or anything tho, but all this really isn't necessary.

"fc4xp4c","I'll ask some questions and bounce some thoughts and ideas around...

&gt;I'm making a story that follows a very simple premise - love triangle goes wrong. The participants in this are a somewhat roguish main character, **a knightly best friend** and a manipulative woman. The three grow fond of each other until disaster leads to the **main character being betrayed by the friend** and woman, leaving him stranded in the wilderness and changed into a monster. 

Here's a big internal character conflict you're going to need to solve. If the best friend is such a knightly, honest person, what could the woman have done to get him to betray his friend? And/or what disaster could have led to that? This is going to be an incredibly tight rope to walk IMO because either he has a semi-justifiable reason or he doesn't. If he does...then it kinda sucks that his best friend, the main character who got betrayed, can't at least kinda see where he was coming from and stays locked his anger and revenge plan against an otherwise good person he had a close friendship with (even if this ""works"" for the main character's characterization, it might make it hard for readers to actually *root* for him). If he doesn't have an even semi-justifiable reason...then he doesn't come off as very knightly or honorable at all.

But also...

&gt;I'm making a story that follows a very simple premise - love triangle goes wrong. The participants in this are a somewhat roguish main character, a knightly best friend and a manipulative woman. The three grow fond of each other until disaster leads to the main character being betrayed by the friend and woman, **leaving him stranded in the wilderness and changed into a monster.** 

That seems extreme...I guess it depends on what happens to him in the wilderness -- and again, maybe it just works for his characterization to be vengeful -- but personally I think it's a pretty major character flaw (well, you did say you were looking for some!) to allow any one experience, however horrible, to completely turn you ""into a monster."" And to so vigorously and steadfastly pursue your revenge. Personally if I survived something like that, I'd simply never want to see or talk to either of the other two characters again. 

&gt;The issue I'm facing is I'm trying to think of ways to show each character's personality to the reader before the fall so that it's understood why each of them did what they did. There are no ""bad guys"" in the beginning. Each of them have personality traits and flaws that bring about the tragedy of this tale resulting in the main character's quest for revenge. 

Well, you'll probably want to show/hint at the main character always having had a spiteful streak. Maybe he holds a grudge against other characters in smaller ways, or is always a bit fixated on any perceived slight that happens to him. 

For the best friend, I kinda think instead of actually making him a ""knightly and honorable"" character, you might be better off having him *perceive* himself that way and link it to his identity/sense of self, but show hints that he's not quite the paragon he thinks he is. 

&gt;Basically the main character is roguish and witty, the best friend is diligent and honest but naive and **the woman is intelligent and cunning but is too willing to serve the greater good**. I need to give the main character a flaw that **causes the woman to conspire to use him as a sacrificial pawn for the greater good resulting** in the best friend betraying him 

Hmm, the woman raises a lot of questions for me too. I could buy her as a general character with these traits, but I am quite uncertain what circumstances might have led her to see sacrificing the MC as being toward ""the greater good."" Is the MC and otherwise scary/evil person, and maybe these other two characters were on his good side, but she can tell that he might turn on her some day or go after her hard if she crosses him? Is he powerful and corrupt and maybe she's trying to protect others/society? How did she get in this situation with him? Was it *intentional* because she's actively *conspiring* to take him down? If not, how will you justify the blindspot in her intelligence that caused her to not see him for what he was sooner?",1577432899,"for the best friend, i kinda think instead of actually making him a ""knightly and honorable"" character, you might be better off having him *perceive* himself that way and link it to his identity/sense of self, but show hints that he's not quite the paragon he thinks he is.   &gt;basically the main character is roguish and witty, the best friend is diligent and honest but naive and **the woman is intelligent and cunning but is too willing to serve the greater good**.","diligent and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"honest but naive","naive",NA,NA,1

Note some of these are test pressings, some are promos, some are misprints, sleeve variants, etc, but all are from 1977 and I'm sure he would be happy to receive any of them.  Just read the notes and look on the right side to see how many are for sale.

Note there was a version that had 11 tracks on the album and came with a 1-sideded 7"" with the song ""Submission"".  Then there was a 12-track version with no extra 7"", and Submission was on the album.  Some versions had a different track order.   Which one to get him really depends on your budget.  You need to look at the notes for each release, and then seem how what the cost is on the marketplace there.

The one that seems to be considered the ""first version"" is generally [this one](https://www.discogs.com/Sex-Pistols-Never-Mind-The-Bollocks-Heres-The-Sex-Pistols/release/2558425), which is 11 tracks and no 7"".  See the notes.  There are about 21 for sale, starting at about €180.  Be sure you take note of the condition given for every item for sale.  ""Mint"" will be super expensive, but probably too nice to ever want to play.  Very Good or Very Good Plus is much more affordable and should play just fine.

[Here's another version](https://www.discogs.com/Sex-Pistols-Never-Mind-The-Bollocks-Heres-The-Sex-Pistols/release/2891608) from '77 that's much more affordable.

"fb3jax2","Way to miss the actual point, as usual.  What was done by the FBI in regards to these FISA warrants was a gross abuse of power.  One of two things happened in this situation.  The first possibility is that the law enforcement and intelligence bureaucracy took it upon themselves to try to thwart a political candidate during an election because they think they know better than the electorate.  That's a perversion of representative governance and a violation of the oath of office that most, if not all, of these bureaucrats have taken.  The second possibility is that officials of the previous administration used the power of intelligence and law enforcement resources to spy on a political opponent with an eye toward damaging their credibility during an election or in case their opponent won that election.  It' could be a little bit of both, I guess.  

Either way, it's concrete evidence that everything we've been saying about secret courts is 100% correct.

I like Killua's hatsu, but comparing his to Gon and saying that therefore Gon should change his is not really a good way to look at it.

It's like saying that a vacuum cleaner isn't a good enough weapon therefore Shizuku should abandon it. But it is the uniqueness of it that makes it even more interesting when she sucks the blood out of you, and that itself makes nen abilities all the more interesting. 

Let's be honest, electricity type abilities are always going to be around in every anime, it's nothing new to be honest, but how many people use a childrens game as their main power. I like Gon's hatsu concept, and I'd rather see it developed than abandoned. Some new super convenient ability will only make Gon more boring and generic. And we haven't really seen Gon master his ability to it's full extant and Togashi did address some of it's problems, so he is aware of them. He also made Gon recognize them and work around them, that's a far better method of writing than giving your MC a full proof power that need no brains put into it, and it's why I look forward to Gon enhancing it rather than change it half way through its developing process. It feels more earned. 

As a final point, killua was always the cool, badass character, it makes sense that his hatsu should reflect that, but a similar hatsu for Gon would be so OC. He's not that type of 'cool', he's more simple and playful. Versatile and unpredictable but not over the top analytical genius like Killua.",1571208685,"let's be honest, electricity type abilities are always going to be around in every anime, it's nothing new to be honest, but how many people use a childrens game as their main power.","honest, but how","honest","but",TRUE,"honest , but how many","many",NA,"how",1

The nice thing about having a crap memory is that it feels like I was watching this again for the first time.  I didn't remember most of it.  Hell, I didn't even remember that Fake Poor was a character.  Wow, just finished typing my notes...I had a lot to say.  Sorry!

**Ep 19**

I love that Joon Young is still concerned about what Pororo is going to eat when he's gone.  Ack, the tears in Safari Jr's voice in this scene got to me, but when he went outside and cried with CEO and Day6 Girl, my feelings subsided.  Way to take a great emotional scene and make it bland.  

Ok, so I was wrong about Dad/Fake Poor.  He knew that Fake Poor wasn't his son?  So he really did leave No Soup For You for money and power and not for a sense of responsibility?  It just makes the whole scene where Dad's brother was blackmailing Rich&amp;Frail that much more absurd.  Did the writer forget that they included that cameo?  Was he blackmailing her only just to keep quiet about No Soup For You being pregnant?  That seems so weak for the amount of money he was asking for.  It's especially absurd because Rich&amp;Frail said that Dad *came to her* asking to be brought out of ""the bottomless pit"".  It wasn't like he was forced out of his relationship with Soup.  

Whoa, Dad finds out that Rich&amp;Frail is actually Rich&amp;Scary because she really did try to hurt her own son.  See, Dad, you could have been with Sweet Soup all of these years, but no, you decided to marry a monster.

Eul:  ""It's not your fault, Joon Young.""  AH!  I was choking up, but then the director had to give us [matching](https://i.imgur.com/eYnf1WG.jpg) single [tears](https://i.imgur.com/zsYavxW.jpg) which completely took me out of the sweetness of the scene, unfortunately.  

Tear alert:  don't you feel bad for denying him soup all of these years, mom!  Ugh, broken.

Why the hell would you give him the only copy of the video?  And if it's set to air in a couple of days, wouldn't the station have a copy?  I'm assuming that there's editing that needs to happen several days ahead of time.  No, it's ""if you can return it several minutes ahead of broadcast, I'd appreciate it.  They'll work with it and know exactly where to place it in the broadcast despite never seeing it before or knowing what it contains.""  This is such bullshit.  ""Here.  You ruined my life, tried to peg a drug scandal on the son you abandoned.  Your evil wife threatened my life and my brother's life, but you're totally trustworthy and will make sure that Hit&amp;Run is brought to justice for a crime that you covered up.""  Right....

Fake Poor:  ""How's Sin Joon Young now?""  Aren't you the guy who was asking him to drop dead like 1 episode ago.  Why do you care?

No Soup For You to Dad:  ""save our kid!  You know doctors!""  And you think that Joon Young with all of his acting money doesn't have the ability to seek out the best doctors himself?

Ah Joon Young interacting with Dad, but from the viewpoint of law student Joon Young.  Dad is crying, we're all crying!  It broke me because Douche Dad finds out that both Joon Young and NS4Y still had the utmost respect for him back then, despite him abandoning them.  And Douche Dad sees that Joon Young was actually super thoughtful and a good kid until Douche destroyed his aspiration and hopefulness by covering up the accident, and that he'll never be able to get to know the promising kid who looked up to him.  

Jik to Joon Young:  ""People who die are lazy.  That's why they die.  For not practicing breathing.""  That's one of the worst things I've ever heard.  I get that he was telling him to keep fighting, but still, the way he said it just rubbed me wrong.

Now Fake Poor is getting charged with embezzlement!  This guy can't catch a break!

So I thought that Eul drove Joon Young's car out to the new house.  Joon Young took a taxi back, so why didn't she just drive back herself, or take a taxi like she's prone to doing despite having no money?

**Ep 20**

Pororo's house!  Yay!  We get a farewell dog scene!  Where's the dog?!  Where's the dog....?  I feel ripped off that we got the house but no dog.

""Give me your phone number so if I can't find anyone better, I'll give you a call.""  I've never seen someone so honest about keeping a guy in her back pocket.

""I don't even check emails in English because I assume they're all spam.""  LOL!!!  I somehow got on the Thai Samsung distribution list and I never open those emails either because I'm afraid they're full of viruses.   I report them as spam, but they still make it through to my spam folder.  They're probably harmless, but because I have no idea what they say, they're scary.

Fake Poor with his blunt, honest, but heartfelt words to someone who doesn't even know who he, himself, is.  The admission that Joon Young amplified the cowardice and shame in Fake Poor got to me.  ""[Is that a compliment?](https://i.imgur.com/SzjThqv.jpg)""  LOL!  Right!  How did Hit&amp;Run like him with this personality?  Joon Young still has enough brain function to put together that this was an underhanded compliment.  Him saying that he wanted to meet him again as a true brother sent me bawling, though.  It was this scene, the scene with dad, and the last scene with mom that got me going the most.  

""I'll stomp you.  I'll get my revenge.  My dad will destroy your dad.""  This girl has no sense of shame, no repentance, she's just selfish and cruel.  She needs therapy pronto.  I hope that this conversation was recorded and will be played when she tries to get parole if/when she's convicted.  

""I thought I could be happy with you once.""  ""Happy"" is subjective, I guess, but he did grow up with a monster of a mother, so maybe his sense of happiness is skewed?  Oh.... the thought that before she had a chance to reveal her true nature.  At least Fake Poor's [haircut](https://i.imgur.com/DUG80TP.jpg) is 8 million times better than it was in [Snow Queen](https://i.imgur.com/Epxg2G1.jpg).  ""If there's a speck of hope in you, I'll wait for you.""!?!?!  Why?  Why would you even slightly consider yoking yourself to this crazy bitch?  Half of the population is women, find someone better.  

Finally Soup For You.  Ugh, when he realized it was mom just from the soup it hurt me.  Then he leads in with ""I hope you know I lived my best life and I couldn't have done better, but I still feel sorry to you."" with tears and snot running down his face.  Stop, KWB, you're killing me here.

"f0ohedo","He perpetuates myths like chemtrails and his understanding of science (or at least how he often portrays things) is not accurate or honest. He misuses the term scientific theory and treats it like a hypothesis or guess. When science claims something as a theory, it means that is the best understanding given the observable or repeatable evidence. In other words, theory is the peak of scientific understanding of something and he treats it as something very different. I have linked the video with the rocks below. Ken Hamm is at least intellectually consistent and honest but Hovind goes out of his way at times to make spurious claims. It would be better if he presented the actual scientific understanding of something from both sides but I do not think he truly understands the science (or at least he does not act as if he does). There are many Christians who are scientists and work in the fields that Hovind claims are actively working against God. Most scientists, regardless of beliefs, are truly only seeking to understand the field they study. 

I respect your views and you have elaborated why you believe them elsewhere. I would hope that you would give other views an honest look and see why Christians can have those. BioLogos is a good resource and has scientists and theologians who spend time explaining things as they understand them. I would also recommend the book *Adam and the Genome* by Dennis Venema and Scot KcKnight. You will not agree with the conclusions most likely but the science of genetics, genetic populations, and theology in light of the science is explained in detail and is very accessible.

"f0o91yq","&gt; “If dudes weren’t so thirsty.”

That’s so fascinating, because I don’t think that’s what’s going on, despite what (on its face) looks like a long-winded thirst post.

I think the overwhelming majority of men are BP, even the majority of the RP community is essentially BP “trying” to break out of BP.

Script theory: what is the traditional and conformist male “dating” script?  Boy meets one (1) girl.  Boy focuses his attention on this one (1) girl.  He is either successful or unsuccessful.  The end.

In sum and substance, that’s the social script behind BP.  That’s what 98% of all men are doing.  98% is a lot of men.  Like, **a lot.**

**Because of that,** 98% of men’s social skills suck.  Why?  Because they don’t really talk or communicate **to women.**  They talk about communicate to **one woman at a time,** and **only if successful,** do they get the opportunity to have some **in depth knowledge** as to **that particular woman only.**

They can’t even comprehend what **just talking** to women looks or feels like.  The male brain.  Singular focus.  Logical, militaristic thinking.  Everything is an operation.  Starting point, objective, plan, the mission.  They see a woman, and they immediately (in their mind) cut through all the social fabric and window dressings, and get right to the no nonsense biological imperatives of why men and women even bother interacting with one another.  I’ll go up to her, she either wants to merge genetics or not.  The end.  And that’s 100% true ... **but** not everyone’s nerves are deadened, not everyone is so good at automatically and unconsciously burying their emotions and rejecting the veil of social bullshit and pleasantries.  The majority of the other 50% of the population actually mentally exists “as one” in the veil of social bullshit .. like a Jedi that is one with the force.

It’s not really **about the sex** at all.  It’s actually a “social/communication” issue.  **In a way,** it’s a **very light** form of the very light end of the autism spectrum.  I completely understand where these guys are coming from.  It’s a redundant question on r/AskMen r/seduction r/asktrp and r/datingadvice

He can read through “fakeness” and “bullshit.”   He doesn’t appreciate it in others.  He certainly doesn’t appreciate it in a potential romantic partner.  He certainly doesn’t want to **build a relationship** on dishonesty or have the initial foundation of a relationship based on anything less than honesty.

“Honesty is a very expensive gift.  Don’t expect it from cheap people.” (Warren Buffett).

Men see “honesty” as a courtesy or gift they give to others they respect.  In fact, that’s what the gesture means in “male”: “I respect you.”  It’s the linguistic equivalent of a smile or relaxed and open body language.

**(Note: “fraud is theft with a smile.” Skipping over the issue of deceit and players).**

The problem is, the real world is not some utopia.  I’ve asked this exact question on this sub.  Women have their own set of gender-specific issues with receiving honest and genuine compliments about their appearance and looks.  Additionally, in the real world, it’s a **very tall order** to **presume** or even **trust** that a **complete stranger** is being **honest** with you.  This is not some **insult** or negative criticism about **you as an individual.**  That’s just a normal part of existing in the real world.  People are not honest.  So, rather quickly, even children learn to not trust strangers.

This is especially true for girls.  For anyone who has either worked in or has friends who have worked in human intelligence, between the G7 countries, when it comes to intelligence operations, “women” are **by far** more easily trainable at collecting human intelligence when compared to men.  This is not about their “intuition.”  This is about the sheer size of their amygdala (20% larger than the male brain).  The female brain is smaller in size (but more dense) than the male brain.  It has more white matter (the RAM of the brain) and less grey matter (the CPU of the brain), in comparison to the male brain.  As a result, the threshold for women to experience and feel anxiety, fear, concern, and similar emotions ... is **substantially lower** than that of men.  Women are already out the door by the time a man **begins** to perceive that something might be wrong.

How does a guy reasonably think a untrained civilian woman, bombarded constantly with messages that men are rapists, sex crazed/hungry/thirsty animals, dishonest/liar/players, etc. is going to **feel** when some complete stranger opens up with ...

“Hey, my name is Jeff.  I know you don’t know me, and I don’t l don’t know you.  Despite all the things you’ve heard about guys, I just want you to know that I’m honest.  I’m not walking up to you to play games or be dishonest.  Here, I’ll even show you by opening up my hand and being honest with you.  I’m going to pour my heart and feelings out on the table for you and be completely transparent.  The only thing I know about you is how you look.  You’re not wearing your college transcript or resume on your back.  Based on the only thing I know about you thus far, I have to say, I’m more than just content.  I’m not one of those guys who only dates Victoria’s Secret models or expects women to look like fitness models at a minimum.  I consider you to be beautiful just the way you are - really.  I really mean that.  So, if you feel like you don’t look beautiful.  If you ever have those doubts about yourself ... because we all do from time to time, I just want to honestly let you know, for whatever it’s worth, I genuinely think you’re beautiful.”

99% probability?  Assume he’s lying and being dishonest.  Why?  Because he’s a man, and that’s what men do.  If it’s one thing men are known to be, besides being sexist, it’s being liars.  Right? (irony emphasized).

1% probability?  Assume he’s being honest.  O.o  That’s so rare, it’s **weird.**  It challenges her notions and expectations of men.  She may not even be prepared to comprehend or accept that level of social or emotional reality.  It’s **too much** and **too soon.**  It’s too deep of a level of intimacy with a complete stranger.  This approach is greatly appreciated in Central and Eastern Europe (and in some parts of France), but definitely not in the urban and highly populated parts of the United States.

It’s kind of like the guy is trying to say, “I’m disarmed” or “I’m not going to rape you or violate you,” or “I’m not one to disrespect your boundaries.”

It’s “honest,” **but,** (1) women have no way of knowing that (because despite the “female intuition” circle jerk, women can’t “read minds” and “know/tell what you’re thinking”); and (2) a paranoia-level fear/suspicion response is **normal.**

I know.  It’s completely ironic when you think about it logically.  The “dishonest” approach that hides under the veil of social bullshit and uses plausible deniability to **transition** into a more overt “I’m hitting on you and expressing my interest towards you” is **more well-received** than a 100% honest and genuine brain dump of exactly how someone is feeling and thinking.

But as many women said in that thread, what’s valued more in the first 1-4 minutes of an interaction (which the initial approach falls under) is:

Displaying **social** intelligence &gt; displaying honesty and emotional transparency.

**Because of all that,** these men don’t have 8-10 women they’re talking to during the week.  They don’t have **options.**  They don’t have 8-10 rods on the water.  They only have a single bullet in a bolt action rifle, and they’re hunting a single deer at a time.  So, when they shoot their single shot at a time ... they go all out.

It definitely comes off as **thirst,** especially on its face.

"ezcoayv","&gt;A relevant question here is how do you sum up the 'soul of a movement' if the minority of assholes has a bigger consequentialist impact than the moderate majority?

I think you have to take into account the nature of the movement, amongst other things.

There is a certain dynamic that I suspect is responsible for the unique properties of the SJ movement that make people so hostile to it. From an outside perspective, the SJ prescription for society has a dependency on people being nice and acting in good faith. I wouldn't go so far as to call it an axiom, but it seems like there is a default background assumption that the downtrodden and oppressed do not abuse the system for their personal gain (at least not enough to bother worrying about).

Consider a movement of people who believe that people almost never lie. They go about trying to spread the good news that everyone is honest and trustworthy. Sounds like a cheerful, honest bunch of people, right? Right. The modal member of the community is kind and honest.

What about the people steering the movement? The ones who gather clout and status? Are they honest folk?

Hell no. They lied and schemed their way into positions of influence. Moloch does not abide an empty social niche.

Maybe the typical member doesn't fully drink the kool aid - they believe people to be basically honest, but in their day to day they trust but verify. Outside of the day to day, the dynamics of the movement will require that they leave all doubt at home. They will be completely at the mercy of anyone who can enter the movement and tell the right lies. They might have a good idea of what's going on, but nothing equips them to act on it. The movement must be a clear example of trusting behaviour, after all.

This would predict that the SJ movement gives outsize influence to people willing to abuse power in exactly those ways which it claims are irrelevant/impossible. For an outside look in, that appears to be sort of the case. I know plenty of people who identify themselves as feminists - maybe two distant friends of mine would not. As far as I can tell, they don't have a problem with me being privileged on every axis. But I am terrified of the possibility that someone malicious/vindictive could rally pretty much everyone I know against me. Does this social structure have the memetic antibodies to reject such an action? I simply can't picture anyone I know saying ""they're obviously just trying to abuse my anti-oppression instincts here. I'm not biting""

For all the flaws of the conservative movement, ""faith in people being fundamentally nice"" is not one, at least outside of certain authoritarian tendencies. Even then, it's not faith in people *in general* being nice, just the leader who totally isn't going to abuse their power.

I'm trying to think of a background assumption in the conservative that could be exploited for personal gain, but I'm having trouble coming up with anything. In my defense, it's 2:30 in the goddamn morning. Any thoughts on what the equivalent might be?

“I’ve noticed lately that you haven’t seemed interested in being intimate.” Make sure it’s not accusatory, judgemental, etc.

Then you want to express concern.

So, “I just want to make sure I didn’t cross any boundaries or make you uncomfortable, so I want to have a conversation about it with you. I know it isn’t always something you like to talk about, but I want to make sure you are okay, and be honest about how I feel.”

Then, follow it up with what you want your next steps to be...

“I think it could be beneficial if you could let me know how we could make you feel comfortable having these conversations without me upsetting you.”

The main big problems with drugs are the legal consequences of getting caught with them, the shitty shit they use to cut them, and high prices. 

Remove those three and add a certified psychiatrist to prescribe them to you and suddenly those drugs turn into medicines or, in some cases, just something that is accepted. 

Coffee was illegal for many years in some places, with long elaborated medical arguments and disproportionate punishments against it, yet many people today couldn't function without it. Yes, being addicted to coffee sucks, but since it's legal, pure, and inexpensive, it's not a big deal.

Of course take that with a grain of salt.  On the one hand, you don’t need her to agree with you in order to move forward with your life, but in the other you need to consider the impact on your relationship with her.

Okay, so that title may cause a knee-jerk but hear me out.

However, sometimes the guys I do this with get attached. I'm very honest and clear from the get-go that I'm only interested in sex, but it doesn't stop them catching feelings. When this happens, I start to feel guilty about various lies I've told. 

These include my name, my experience, and my gender identity; I'm genetically female, but don't identify as such. When I'm online, I take on a female persona. Sometimes I've tried being honest, but it always spirals into socio-political arguments or them just no longer being attracted to me.

Staying with someone because you believe they may hurt themselves if you don't is a really, **REALLY** shitty reason to stay with someone. 

If someone tells you they'll hurt themselves if you leave them, it is abuse. Absolute emotional manipulation. 

Now, if she didn't say that expressly, and you're just concerned about her well-being, that's commendable, but you're not doing anyone any favors by staying in a relationship that you're not into.

She talks really fast and doesn't give you a moment in which to break in, and will move seamlessly from story to story. She has a compulsion to review her life over and over. I talked to her alone about it and found out that she knows she does it, and is embarrassed, but has a hard time stopping. She also has a great sense of humor, so now I can tease her affectionately when she's been monopolizing the conversation (I do like hearing what she has to say, but like you want to hear others and follow through on some of the good conversation points before the subject is changed), and we all laugh. It's been a great relief to me to have a little control over it. Perhaps having a quiet, one-on-one, honest but affectionate or respectful talk with her would help.

"embfrmr","I went to a private school where most kids who paid tuition weren’t particularly bright, but their parents were rich and did expect them to get into university. But the issue was standardized exams, which can’t be bought. 

Some of our teachers just tried to help us prepare for exams in an honest but fair way, others would literally give us all the information we were supposed to write down (for internal assessment) and people just copied it. Some “invigilators” would conveniently leave the classroom in the middle of an exam so that students could give each other answers or look at their textbooks. 

Now most of those classmates are in the same private university, likely doing the exact same thing at a higher level.  

So it’s not just a “cultural” thing, it’s human nature. When people are put under a lot of pressure to succeed and they aren’t up to par, they will try to find ways to game the system to make it work for them.

"emb9fko","I would recommend the [MIT lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/) that you've linked. I've watched them and I thought they were good. There is also an older version of the same course [available here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/video-lectures/). The older version is probably more difficult (more mathematical and more thorough). Both courses start at the beginning and I believe they both go over analysis of algorithms and asymptotic notation (i.e. big-O notation). At least, I'm sure the older course has big-O notation since that is where I learned it.

Depending on your background, you might get a bit bogged down in some of the mathematical proofs, especially in the older course. I honestly wouldn't sweat that too much. Most of the results follow from a couple basic facts from calculus and if you don't understand calc, it's fine to just memorize those things. 

As others have said, language choice really doesn't matter for this subject, as long as you can basically follow along. A good exercise would be to try to implement the algorithm you study into a language of your choice. Lectures in the older course are done pretty much entirely in pseudocode. The newer course uses pseudocode and Python. Python is extremely approachable and you can easily follow Python code even if you've never seen it before (there's a reason it's called 'executable pseudocode').

One more note, Erik Demaine (the tall, long-haired guy in both these MIT lectures) is a great teacher. He's kind of like a teaching assistant in the older video series but tag-team teaches   with another prof in the second series. His [web site](http://erikdemaine.org/) has links to other courses he's taught and they are also pretty instructional.

"elep8c5","Thanks for the reply mate, as for the defensive schemes, i would disagree, on the basis that the players have brains. Dave is our captain, to let a free header like that occur is bad enough but the other 2 goals weren't shut down quick enough in my opinion, bad leadership and professionalism was what caused us to panick and allow goals like that to occur. Sarri can be blamed for not seeing this earlier, sure, but this leads me to believe, that maybe these players made mistakes that are normal in their first season under new regime. If you're not satisfied with that then i'd say you have to simply be patient and judge this team during the second season as professional footballers, if they continue to make the same mistakes in the second season as the same players then id not only blame Sarri and the players but also the board for not recognising this issue. 

As for Jorginho, you're right he did, but at the same time they were able to score 3 goals, and were hungry for that 4th, they were close too and weren't showing signs of slowing up either. It goes both ways if im honest, but fine, ill give you that, maybe he did come up against tired league 1 level legs, but that completely takes out of context the game itself of how we nearly let that game slip, could've been embarrassing if they did make it 4-4, but they didnt, and more importantly what does it say about premier league level chelsea conceding 3 against league 1 level tier teams in Slavia P. It shows that it took Jorginho to come on and sharpen the team up in all areas. And i don't think he's always been shut out against top class sides, as a whole team we certainly have been shut out, but just him is harsh, he's put in top performances against liverpool at home and man city, as well as spurs. He played really well, out of all our players he's capable of playing one touch pass football, watch how he acts as a pivot point in this team, he's mostly always misunderstood as a ""regista"" it must the name that makes him sound like he's untouchable, but hes human and made mistakes, all he's done is his best this season and its been far from a bad first season from him considering the losses we've taken as a team, collectively its not been good but look at where we are in all things considered, still fighting like this club always does.",1555829685,"it goes both ways if im honest, but fine, ill give you that, maybe he did come up against tired league 1 level legs, but that completely takes out of context the game itself of how we nearly let that game slip, could've been embarrassing if they did make it 4-4, but they didnt, and more importantly what does it say about premier league level chelsea conceding 3 against league 1 level tier teams in slavia p.","honest, but fine","honest","but",TRUE,"honest , but fine","fine",NA,NA,1

But I feel something deep inside me pulling me outside, far from home. It resided in me since this morning, slowly and steadily growing into an aching pain. I felt as if I had forgotten something, something incredibly important.

I'm walking by a field and just manage to register the glow of the midnight glories. Opening to the night sky on this moonless night, glowing just irridecintly to be called a wavering beauty. Hues of purple, blues and white lighting my way towards an open field. Dragonflies dancing above the glow, and the sound of their wing beats humming loudly in the air.

But still, I could not stop. The closer I approached the field, the tighter my throat got, and tears seemed to well in my eyes. Something was lost here. Something that ment the world to me. But what?

I reach the field and stop dead in the center. The dragonflies started to swarm the flowers around the field, which seemed to start glowing even brighter than before. There seems to be something opening in front of me. At first it resembled a small black dot, but after blinking once, it expanded into a wide hole, that seemed ripped from the sky itself.

There was something calling me. Without a second thought, I threw myself into it. I felt a burning sensation that tingled throughout every cell my body was made of. A second was all it took and I was there.

I stood in front of my husband and two children. Relief filled their eyes, followed by tears and embraces. I remember now.

Something caused these pockets of space to open all around the world. Not knowing where they went to, normal people where enticed by money to accept going through one. In a fit of rage, I walked right into one, trying to make my husband scared. I was gone for years, living a life completely diffrent from where I started. But I came back.

"ecxevyb","Tinder's algorithm seems to be a bit of a secret so nobody *really* knows how it all works behind the scenes. I see a lot of guys saying that only the best looking guys have success on there but there but in my experience this is a bit of an oversimplification.  There's no way of knowing how many girls actually see your profile so if your profile is low-effort or you're right-swiping everyone, the algorithm that shows profiles and matches could ensure that girls actually hardly ever see your profile and you wouldn't know the difference between this and not getting matches due to girls left-swiping you.

I jumped back on Tinder in March 2018 after a long hiatus from the platform. Armed with 2 photos and an honest but witty bio that shows that I don't take myself too seriously. The result? I met some lovely and interesting people! Have I had conversations via text that ultimately went nowhere? Yes. Did I go on several dates where the person seemed nice but just happened to be looking for something different? Definitely. It's a numbers game after all and to treat it too seriously would be silly. Did I have a degree of success via the app? Yes I did, but it's worth nothing that I persisted with it and didn't take any of it seriously.

Anybody on Tinder is competing with many, many other guys and that's why it can suck. The girl that just ghosted you possibly did so because she is being overwhelmed with messages and the other guy just happens to have a dog in his main photo, you'll never really know but most importantly **it doesn't matter**. That's the nature of the beast and that's why it can suck. Yes, some people are there for validation or just to kill time at their boring job but I attribute any successes that I've had on Tinder just to general honesty and making my intentions clear from the start.

"eam1xdq","I was always overweight as a child, then beginning around 11 or so it got worse...  By 7th grade I was a size 14.  By the end of high school I was over 200 lbs.  And somewhere in my late 20s I hit 300 lbs.  My high weight was my starting weight, 367.  I played softball intermittently through those years, but never very competitively... And never was any more than what the charts would call “sedentary”.

My cardiologist (who I had to seek the advice of at age 31 because of an acute high blood pressure incident that put me in the ER with 240/120 blood pressure) suggested that I try and lose some weight, even just 10% of my body weight would help.  He mentioned that a lot of his patients had good luck with very low carb diets, and that I should look into Atkins or Keto.   So I did, and I halfheartedly tried it for a couple of months and lost a little weight, but I let myself “cheat” periodically and eventually fell off the wagon and regained everything I had lost.  

Six months later, I was aggravated with myself and just fed up and sick of being fat and sick and of dreading going to the doctor.  I had just finally passed the exam for this very difficult professional license that took me several attempts, and I got the idea in my head that “If I can do that, I can do anything”.  So I told myself I was going to lose weight and not cheat this time, no matter what.  Failure was not an option.  So I white-knuckled my way through for about three months of low carb until it finally became habit.  And now eating a very low carb diet is just my normal.  I don’t even crave junk 99% of the time.  And when I do, I can make a fathead pizza and satisfy the craving without falling off of the wagon.  

It wasn’t until the last month or two that I started exercising.   At first it was to get myself through a stall, but then I discovered that I LOVE walking outside in nature.  So I developed a habit of walking on a trail near my house almost every day, and hiking whenever I can.  And I continue to make strength and endurance gains with that, and am having a lot of fun!  

So in summation, how am I achieving that weight loss rate?   A low carb diet (under 30g net carbs a day), a decent calorie deficit (I think, anyway...I don’t really even track anymore to be honest, but last I tracked it was somewhere around a 30% deficit without accounting for exercise), one-meal-a-day intermittent fasting that came naturally as I got into the low carb diet, and getting more active.  

But 2-3 lbs per week STILL feels positively glacial!  Lol.  Or maybe I’m just super damn impatient and ready to not be fat anymore!

Feel free to point me to various studies but why don't you also find studies that don't backup your assumptions so we've got a full range of evidence to work from? Or do you not search for those because you're living in your own echo chamber? You're the one who started a thread so the burden of evidence is on you not me.

It's not that I don't like what you're saying, I just don't agree with it. I can understand based on what you've told me about your life how you arrived at this conclusion to some degree but I think you've got a lot of learning to do before you can assert this more fully, especially if you want to suggest society is going to ruin because of it

The evidence is in the many, many relationships out there completely unaffected by how many sexual partners each participant in the relationship has had.

You're distilling everything that a 'perfect marriage' is into whether they've had sex or not and relationships are so impossibly complex that they can never be down to one singular aspect of it. I'll bet there are tonnes of failed marriages out there that resulted from both partners being utterly shite in bed and never satisfying each other. Usually when cheating occurs it's down to a deep level of dissatisfaction and sex is a part of that, usually quite a big one. It also sounds like you feel like a perfect marriage means a perfect life and that's all anyone should aspire to which fundamentally ignores the fact that every single one of us wants something different to everyone else at any given time. Therefore trying to stop people from doing things because you don't like it is a bit of a pointless affair isn't it?

It also sounds like you're idealizing relationships and idealizing sex. Once you learn to do neither and accept the flaws in both through experience, you may find yourself feeling completely different but you are understandably apprehensive about allowing yourself to be out there and be vulnerable. Like I said, your first time won't be perfect and your first relationships won't be either. That doesn't mean that the first person you sleep with and have a relationship with won't last a lifetime but accept that it'll likely be an awkward affair in all aspects and you'll have to work hard on yourself to make it work as a whole. You tell people to think of relationships as more than just sex but you're using 'just sex' as a stick to beat those that aren't in loving relationships.

Relationships don't go sour because one or both partners have slept around and society isn't going to collapse in on itself because we're quite happy having sex with whoever we want, when we want.

"e6ffg21","Truth is that Replace-By-Fee transactions in BTC is more opt-out than opt-in now. More and more wallets just use them by default rather than the other way around.

The reason for this is full blocks and the ""fee market"". Wallets can't know with 100% certainty how much competition there will be to get into the next block. Analyzing the current mempool and overshooting the current average fee is not guaranteed to work, in the next minute after you send your tx there may be 1000 more txs sent that nobody knows about. Or 10 tx that have 1000s of inputs (and take up many bytes of the next block).

So since the user (or wallet) do not know before the tx is sent if it has enough fee you have to set the tx before sending it to replace-by-fee just in case it turns out to be needed later. **End result is that you can assume many if not most txs in the mempool are replace-by-fee enabled.**

If a BTC merchant accepts 0-conf but requires the tx to not be replace-by-fee how will he handle the situation when an honest but clueless BTC user sends him a tx that the user thought was acceptable but ended up having replace-by-fee enabled by his wallet? Will he ask the customer to wait until the next block? Will he ask him to send a new tx without RBF? Can the customer trust the merchant to return the first tx he mistakenly sent with RBF? Is it reasonable to ask the customer to bother to spend the first tx back to himself now with a higher fee? What if the customer don't now how to turn off RBF, will you take time to check his wallet software and try to help him? All the while a queue of other customers build in the line behind him.

The only reasonable thing for a BTC merchant to do is to not accept 0 conf because the risk of having a customer send a replace-by-fee enabled tx to him is way too big. It's basically not just likely to happen at some point, it's practically guaranteed because of the fact that BTC's replace by fee is more opt-out than opt-in nowadays.",1537607924,"**  if a btc merchant accepts 0-conf but requires the tx to not be replace-by-fee how will he handle the situation when an honest but clueless btc user sends him a tx that the user thought was acceptable but ended up having replace-by-fee enabled by his wallet?","honest but clueless","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but clueless","clueless",NA,NA,1
"e6fbug4","I think I didn't make it clear enough for which I apologize. To clarify, the beta-amyloid plaques are found in Alzheimer's patients, but not necessarily the other forms of dementia. Other forms of dementia have their own characteristics (eg. Lewy-body dementia has alpha-synuclein instead of beta-amyloid, frontotemporal dementia has FTLD-tau/TDP etc).

&gt; Do you find the beta-amyloid plaques with dementia in other areas of the brain?

I think what you're asking is where the beta-amyloid is found in the brain in Alzheimer's patients? It depends on the stage. [Here is a diagram that shows typical progression](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201556/figures/1).

To guide you through the diagram, the top shows where the beta-amyloid plaque is found as time progresses and at the bottom the tau neurofibrils (aka tangles) which I referenced in the last post but I will just focus on the beta-amyloid for now.

* You can see it starts (Stage A) in areas which are involved with short-memory eg. hippocampus, but it has some frontal and temporal lobe involvement

* It later spreads throughout the most of the frontal and temporal regions, and even the parietal regions. This spread will be associated with what features you see. So early in the disease, you'll tend to find short-term memory loss due to it starting at those areas, then as it spreads throughout the frontal/temporal areas you will see losses in problem solving, changes in personality, facial-recognition, long-term memory, have language problems etc. And as it hits the parietal lobes perhaps changes like loss of ability to judge distance etc.


&gt; Are there any sort of treatments for dementia that isn't Alzheimers? 

I'm not well versed in the treatment on dementia to be honest, but most dementias have no cure, so the treatments are just there to help with the symptoms. Let me give you an example of what I mean in Alzheimer's disease but the principles are applicable for the other dementias.

Let's say your problem is short-term memory loss. If you study a bit about the pathways involved in short-term memory, you'll find that Acetylcholine is an important chemical involved in short-term memory pathways.

In Alzheimer's the beta-amyloid is causing the destruction of the brain cells involved in short-term memory, so you're not going to produce as much Acetylcholine. So what you do is give a drug that blocks the destruction of Acetylcholine, so that of the remaining Acetylcholine that you produce, you make it last longer. These drugs are called cholinesterase inhibitors. So you can see that it helps you work with what you still have, but it doesn't reverse the issue of the beta-amyloid being there and continuing to spread, so it's effectiveness will decline as the disease progresses (therefore cholinesterase inhibitors are only used in early Alzheimers).

Another example of drugs used are antioxidants such as Vitamin E. Because the beta-amyloid among other things are causing lots of destruction through oxidation, antioxidants help to reduce this damage, but they don't cure the disease.

I have learned that life is far too short and that we simply must surround ourselves with those who are honest but supportive of us.

When I finally realized my sexuality wasn't what I thought it would be, that I wouldn't be straight, I was horrified. I was horrified because of people like you and what they did to people like me.

The entire generation ahead of us died before people realized what was up with HIV and AIDS. Even today, because of attitudes like your original ones, people call it a gay disease despite it existing since the 1920s and in straight people until the 60s-90s. That stigma is the reason many people still won't come out and get tested and so on.

I was terrified someone would figure it out, that I might catch something, that someone would hate me just for being me, for something I didn't want and didn't choose. 

Because of the area, I couldn't just run to NYC or somewhere so I stayed closeted for too long. Eventually though, some of my family figured things out. Over time I came out to most of them, perhaps not officially but most definitely implied with my ""roommates"" and ""friends."" 

I was ""lucky"" because I could blend in. I could fit in with anyone and didn't exude ""the gay"" as some would call it. The tough ones are those who can't or won't blend in. They suffered more than I can imagine. I can seriously say that the pain your son felt must've been unimaginable to me and certainly to most straight people. 

I'm glad you came around. An ally is an ally even if it was a hard fought battle to get you to that point. There's a side of me that is raging with anger at you and those like you during that period. There are so many. I hope you spoke up to the family and cut those off that still treated him that way years later.

&gt;When you give consent, it's not like it's a single 'yes' that covers from now until the heat death of the universe. People are and always were free to withdraw consent at any point in time.

And how does that work ey bud? If they say yes and then revoke consent right before I'm about to blow a massive load, am I a rapist if I cum?  
If they say yes but then afterwards retro-actively revoke consent, am I a rapist?  
On top of that, what of times when apparently even a beginning and continuous ""yes"" is apparently not indicative of consent? If both I and a woman are drunk and I receive constant consent, apparently I can still be considered a rapist because she could not have consented. That consent can be invalidated in the eyes of the law.  
So what is and what isn't consent? How am I supposed to adequately protect myself from breaking the law accidentally, if whether or not I've broken the law is entirely out of my hands?  

&gt;There basically has to be enough solid evidence there to convince a judge or a jury of people who don't understand how any of this shit works.

And yet we fairly consistently see people being convicted of rape for participating in the situations I have mentioned. And even if not convicted, they can still be arrested and held for months on end, and that will stay with them forever. Job opportunities are lost, friends are lost, lives are often taken. How you can be so cavalier about this is mind-boggling.

&gt;It's not like there's a whole parade of well meaning men and women who are accidentally getting done in by these laws.

Remember earlier when you said that case law is important? And now you're claiming it's fine because it's only ruining SOME peoples lives?  
I guess you're right. Ruining peoples lives is fine so long as you don't do it too often. The law is fine, problems with the law is what happens to OTHER people, not you, right?

&gt;The Bar isn't really talking about rape.

Demonstrably they are. 

&gt;They're arguing about the importance of mens rea in a criminal offence and whether a person's 'recklessness' in not considering whether there was consent

See already you're being disingenuous. If a person ""honestly believes there was consent"" then you re-phrase that as them being reckless and not even considering whether there was consent. Because the problem doesn't affect you. To you, it's obvious, and if she doesn't consent then you just don't have sex. Because it's always easy to know exactly when you do and don't have consent. Because false accusations happen to other people. Because you've never needed to prove affirmative consent, and so it need not exist in your mind.

&gt;The Bar President's conclusion was that if we're going to criminal honest but unreasonable beliefs then we should pass a separate act similar to say manslaughter and murder where you did not intend to kill someone but they died anyway. 

Are they wrong on that? This kinda goes against everything you've been saying up to this point.

&gt;Also as others have pointed out, the Law Society has no problems with the law as is.

And did you read their justification? It completely ignores the very problem with affirmative consent that we're discussing, and ignores the ""reasonable belief"" portion to just claim that it's already good enough.  
The Law Society are wrong.

"e2vg23b","&gt;People tend to forget that legislation like the ones in place now don't exist in a vacuum. Over time, they change peoples views.

Actually people have no idea how the law works case in point your posting.

Legislation doesn't change people's views. It's the other way around which is why case law is given as much weighting in a courtroom if not more so than words in an Act written decades ago and why we often use a jury of your peers to determine guilt.

&gt;The claim by some that changes in the law seek to ""protect rapists"" is farcical, because the idea that rape is bad is ingrained into hundreds of years of Western cultural history.

Marital rape only became a crime in the late 1970s. Prior to that you could totally rape your partner and people would be fine with it or at least turn the other way.

&gt;But now we have well-meaning people who have run afoul of the nebulous ""revoking consent"" concept. Good people who have had sex while drunk, or had sex with a person who regretted it, or even in rare cases who have just been accused without having had sex at all: And they are in the eyes of the law, no better able to defend from such an accusation than a genuine rapist.

And this is exactly what I mean.

When you give consent, it's not like it's a single 'yes' that covers from now until the heat death of the universe. People are and always were free to withdraw consent at any point in time.

On top of that, we're talking about a criminal charge. It's not like in the movies or on tv where they just jump to a court room scene. 

What happens in real life is that the DPP looks at all the evidence the police have collected and then determine if there's a case and more importantly, if they can win that case because nobody likes a prosecutor who loses. The decision to go to court is made by someone whose expertise and skill is deciding whether a criminal act has occurred and whether there's enough evidence to prosecute. There basically has to be enough solid evidence there to convince a judge or a jury of people who don't understand how any of this shit works.

It's not like there's a whole parade of well meaning men and women who are accidentally getting done in by these laws.

&gt;So yes, these Barristers are completely right.

The Bar isn't really talking about rape. They're arguing about the importance of mens rea in a criminal offence and whether a person's 'recklessness' in not considering whether there was consent or being aware of the possibility that there isn't consent is the same as someone who knows that they do not have consent.

"e2v81j1","You can definitely beat Ex 2 and Ex 4 with a fresh baked account with just Noctis Aranea and a good carry. I managed to pull it off on 2 such accounts. A high level Noctis made it pretty easy to clear Ex 2 since you can double the LS with your own Noctis making him extremely durable. Ex 4 was pretty much Gilga's work, so you can try to bring someone with Lightning 50% PATK LS to help him out further. Ex 3 was a harderr clear for me to be honest, but still manageable with Gilga and 50% PATK LS from my Lucretia. I don't have Ignis so I don't think I will do Ex 1 at all.

Try to see if you can bring some 4* units, they are surprising ""not bad"" even in suboptimal state.

"e2jzix7","It's hard to give an informed opinion without details, but I do think a lot of general ""cold reading"" can be done unconsciously. Like, you might be sitting in church praying, and you happen to notice one particular person down the pew because they look really intense or a little upset. Noticing them feels spontaneous so you assume ""aha, God must be prompting me to notice this person. You dwell on this possibility for a while with your imagination free to run wild, and then find yourself feeling *convinced* that it must be because god wants you to go pray for them. So you get yourself all psyched up and you go over there and are like ""hey, I just felt prompted by god that you were in need of some sort of prayer or encouragement.""

And you both walk away from it feeling like this was a supernatural experience.

In reality, this person stood out to you because there was something a bit unusual about their demeanor (being very intense/distraught looking) you subconsciously processed this information and felt intrigued or drawn or concerned about them, you assigned a supernatural meaning to this (god must want you to do something) you went over and said something rather nonspecific about their situation based on the unconscious information you'd already processed (they look like they need prayer) and they are caught off their guard by having such an unexpected and serendipitous interaction with you and thus also assign this to a supernatural cause, causing both of you to inflate the significance of the event in your minds.

"e197phr","Im in a relationship but i don’t see it as anymore complexed than before. My dad had tried to be with my mom for years until she finally said yes. And because there was a stigma about sex before marriage Im sure it was on the mind of every woman not to do anything that wasn’t marriage. Now it’s more open minded and free to explore.

As for dating now, I think it’s confusing only because we make it confusing. Maybe the few interactions people have with women make them feel as though they are random and mysterious but I think they think the same way we do for the most part. All the things we would probably call a girl crazy for, they call us creepy. Also taking into consideration that we are often bigger, there is a slight tilt towards fear every interaction.

But the trick to me (at least in theory because I’m more of a relationship guy, and I’m currently in one) is to be honest but make sense. For example, if you like a girl bc she is good looking, tell her but don’t fantasize about her to the point were you have an unrealistic expectation for her. I think girls can tell when you are projecting an ideal woman on them and that would make us look creepy just like if a girl did that to us we’d thing they’re a little to giddy about us for what’s reasonable.

At that point, if it doesn’t work out, it’s not on you. She just wasn’t feeling you like that, and as long as you were just looking at her as a person, then it wouldn’t bug you that you guys are just different because it’s only looks and there are billions of other people who look good. If it tears you apart that *this* girl rejects you that means you weren’t looking at the girl in front of you but rather the idea of what you thought she is which is obviously painful. You don’t really know a valuable person worth feeling hurt for until they’ve been with you through the hard shit.

And if that’s a long standing friend who has been through the hard shit with you and you want to date her, rule still applies. Be honest and tell her that you’ve always thought she has been pretty (although by then she probably should have heard that from you) and that she’s been a really good friend because of x, y,z etc, and that you’d like to lock her down before anyone takes her away from you.

Love can also make you realize that things that seemed superficial actually aren't and vice versa. For example, I always knew I wanted to be with someone who played an instrument.

Meanwhile things like ""creativity"" weren't actually as important as I realized. A person can be smart and interesting without being necessarily creative.

"dy8f9m5","I think that the most important thing to keep in mind, as OneEyeRob put it, is that Hit Points also represent ""presence on the battlefield.""

I recommend looking at the TV Tropes regarding Redemption. It is a fairly common plot trope for a villain with a heinous plan \(usually regarding a super weapon\) to be convinced by the hero\(es\) at the last minute not to carry out their plan. Sometimes they submit, sometimes they join the allies, and sometimes they risk/give their life\(s\) to stop the heinous plan \(or at least attempt to\).

I think it would be perfectly reasonable for a party to come into the dragon's lair, and \(while avoiding being cooked/eaten\) proceed to browbeat/insult/compliment/harass the dragon until it just decides that the party can take what they want because *it* is going back to sleep. GM gets their boss battle, party gets the loot, nobody dies; that is what I would call a win/win/win \(for those of you familiar with Michael Scott's resolution system\). 

Prescience would be an interesting angle of attack against Resolve, but only in specific situations. It could wear down against the villain about to set off ""the plan,"" if the hero\(es\) go into specific detail about real consequences. The hero\(es\) would have to be completely honest, but very detailed. 

Example: BBEG became a villain because they lost a family member/love. Law enforcement would not help them, government would not help them, church would not help them, no one would help them. They became a villain to take matters into their own hands, and plan on unleashing a super\-weapon against those who turned them away. By being very detailed about the consequences related to harming innocent people, and the possibility of putting someone else \(or several hundred other people\) into BBEG's own origin story situation, the PCs have the ability to get them to have a change of heart. At least long enough to end their Heinous Plan^(TM).

Now, there are some caveats to this example: The line between Prescience and Influence would be very finely drawn \(though Influence would certainly help\). Prescience could be used for any Reasonable Conclusion^(R), where Influence could be used for reasonable or extremely exaggerated possible outcomes.

"dxn9cae","Listen: this debate turns entirely on whether you believe it is morally and/or legally permissible to terminate a pregnancy. 

Some people believe that it is. It's not just that they think this for kicks: some believe that this flows axiomatically from the idea of personal autonomy, some have had personal experiences where the unavailability of abortion has caused harm, and some view it as an issue of female reproductive choice. To people who have accepted this premise and reasoning, the contrary reasons given seem spurious, morally untenable, and made in bad faith to undermine what everyone *really* knows to be right.

Some people believe that it is not. It's not just that they think this for kicks: some believe that life begins at conception, some have extremely strong and sincerely held religious beliefs about the practice, and some believe that the issue has been blown out of proportion by honest, but nevertheless mistaken, groups getting involved politically. To people who have accepted this premise and reasoning, the contrary reasons given seem spurious, morally untenable, and made in bad faith to undermine what everyone *really* knows to be right.

The fact that these two points of view can and do co-exist mirrors why the country faces this dilemma: from a moral and legal perspective the question is not positive (what is the law?) but normative (what should the law be?). Laws frequently create rights, and most of the government and judiciary's job, as representatives of the people and the Constitioun respectively, are to adjudicate conflicts between those rights. When is it permissible to remove a person's right to liberty to protect the right to life of another, for example. 

In this case, because of the recency of this issue, the severity of its consequence, and the strong passions it inflames, there is no historical consensus on what is morally and legally acceptable. So the debate becomes an argument from first principles. 

If you accept, as an absolute principle, that life begins at conception, of course you think it's morally abhorrent to allow abortion, even in the most extreme cases - and therefore when a majority of the population seems to be seeking legal abortion, it is a natural result that you frame the debate in terms of a majority trying to quash (your) inconvenient views. 

By contrast, if you accept, as an absolute principle, that a woman has an absolute right to choose what happens to her body, then of course you view restriction of abortion as an infliction by others of their beliefs on you - and therefore when snide commentators espouse views that would never exist in your framework of principles because they are anathema to your foundational conception of autonomy, of course you ridicule those views as existing outside of the norm - because they exist outside of *your* norm. 

The repeal campaign may seem as though they are simply denouncing and ridiculing others - but in large part that is attributable to the fact that they justifiably believe that that their argument flows naturally from the principles of bodily integrity and personal autonomy that lie close to the heart of our society. From that perspective, the arguments raised against repealing *do* seem shameful and ridiculous, because there is an underlying hypocrisy in asserting that everyone is entitled to do as they please with their body - except, for reasons predominantly associated with either personal beliefs or religion, pregnant women. 

And if you don't accept those principles, it's easy to write off the assertion that those arguments are shameful and ridiculous as snide virtue-signalling by smug, disinterested trolls - because there is a huge gulf between what is obvious to you, and what is obvious to them.",1524170313,"it's not just that they think this for kicks: some believe that life begins at conception, some have extremely strong and sincerely held religious beliefs about the practice, and some believe that the issue has been blown out of proportion by honest, but nevertheless mistaken, groups getting involved politically.","honest, but nevertheless","honest","but",TRUE,"honest , but nevertheless mistaken","mistaken",NA,"nevertheless",1
"dxc93kp","Women are incapable of realizing that the things they want and the things they need are most of the time entirely separate domains.

They claim they want Mr. Right, but what they need is endless dick until the wall hits and it's no longer on-demand.

They claim they want equality, but what they need is male slavery and extra privilege.

They claim they want a more responsible place in the world, but every action and word that pours from them reeks of escape from it.

Women fundamentally refuse to confront this inherently self-contradicting mentality; the only times they'll even address it is if a man challenges them on an issue, but women will fight to the death to deny their natures, and you will be the first casualty if they have anything to say about it.

"dwf8t3s","Constantly remind yourself: it is 10000x easier to just tell the truth ALL the time about EVERYTHING than it is to tell little white lies that may save you an ounce of embarrassment because it will always be more embarrassing later on when someone finds out you've lied. People are more likely to forgive someone for disappointing them than they are to forgive someone for lying to them.

It's so much work to lie and keep stories straight, to constantly worry the person might find out you're lying etc. If you're just honest and truthful in every single thing you do. Then, you eliminate so much anxiety in your life.

I did this maybe...15 years ago and it was life-changing. It's a hard habit to break -- for me, I just lied to my parents constantly and about stupid little things, but once I stopped doing it, it made life so much easier. No one can get truly upset with you for being honest, but they will be upset if you tell a white lie and they find out.

It's very liberating, actually, but does take some time for it to become second-nature.

Doing so changes expectations and you quickly realize that no one will ever be impressed by you promising you can get something done in a short amount of time if you don't actually do it.

Hello! It's me, Frusty TheFrustratedMan! Reader of Worm, Color of Paper, a Slave to All! Man, it feels like it's been a year since I posted but in reality it has only been a day!

Okay, so here's the deal. Was working on the Illustrations, y'know the ones that I've been workin' on recently? Well, the difficulty just jumped up from the Elsa and Beako one. It's a little more than difficult to be honest, but doable. And fun, if I must add.

Anyways, while I was working on it, my partner, or adviser on what looks nice to be specific, told me I needed to slow it down. I don't generally do that kind of stuff when I get started. When the train starts, it doesn't end until it falls off a cliff. When that happens, it never starts again.

To ensure my train doesn't fall off a cliff, I'm gonna have to make the tracks twist and turn, which may make the trip awhile longer before it stops at the next station. To put it in other words, I'll be taking breaks and I'll start posting on specific days. Maybe Friday or Saturday. Something like that.

I enjoy doing this, but I don't want it to end prematurely. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. That being said however, I still am open to requests. My current work so far is as follow-

Vainglory Insanity (Pandora and Bete/Petelguese)- 33% complete

A Forgotten Day [Working Title] (Regulus and Ley)- 5% complete

The First Date (Emilia and Subaru)- 11% complete

I think I found a nice shade of color for Bete in his work. I just need'a test it out. Once I'm done with him the background comes next. I fear how difficult that may be.

I'm not good at making a believable shade for the sky. Regulus and Ley are easy, but the sky messes me up. That may take a long while.

This last one is probably the easiest, but most frustrating. For reasons that escape me, Black, White, Gray, Silver and similar colors don't work at all on the background. I've been testing out Pandora's hair color on Emilia, but it may take awhile to get this to work.

Anyways, thank you for the support and sorry for the giant block of text! I'm gonna finish reading my chapter of Worm.

"dv93kvt","I just want to start by saying: I do not do drugs. I drink 1/4 cup of wine at lunch each day medicinally. This entire experience was completely sober.

I first started meditation and creation around 15. I have manifested some crazy stuff but only recently have I became devout to my higher consciousness. I did not pay attention to any literature on channeling beings. However, last week I was focusing my thought energy into creation and then resting, then repeating. It was around midnight. 

 I was laying on my bed taking a break, I noticed something sitting on my lower back, maybe weighed 10 lb's and based on the area of pressure on me, it was at least 1 or 2 feet in diameter. This has never occurred before. It was like a baby was laying on me.

I looked back to see what was on me. But I could see nothing. I could only feel it sitting or laying on me. I assumed it was an entity or gravity field or whatever. It's not like I should be afraid. So I didn't really care aside from being interested. I rolled over on my back and I no longer felt anything sitting on me. 

I rolled back onto my stomach to see if I was just having some weird nerve issues. I did not feel anything sitting on me. I guess, it moved or left. I shrugged the experience off and began to project my positive energy and focusing my will.

As usual, tears start rolling down from my eyes like they always do. But this time, I felt a sudden urge to break through to a higher level and exceed the norm. I suddenly became intensely focused and was able to produce an insane amount of love and emotional energy that radiated out far more explosively than I had EVER experienced before.

And at that time, my bedroom ...it's hard to describe... but my bedroom was shrinking inward infinitely and bulging out into infinity in all directions at once. The walls were swollen out and inward simultaneously. Also, my awareness had expanded out to the edges of existence and also into infinitely tiny particles that just kept going. I could feel all of it- all of creation. I felt infinitely huge and infinitely tiny. It was like my mind was the universe and I owned all of existence and all of existence owned me. I was one with all that is/was/will be. I truly felt what it is to be one. It's actually not what I expected, to be honest, but equally incredible.

 And it was at this moment where I got very frighted of this level of expansion. It actually scared me. I was actually worried that I was breaking my physical mind/body. I then backed out of it by reducing the intensity of my focus. All was back to normal again.

So, in summary, I believe a being may have visited me to help me expand my consciousness. I have not yet felt that presence again. And I have not been able to achieve that level of consciousness again either. 

I do carry with me, however, a much more expanded understanding and confirmation of my existence. And the ""physical"" world around me is so much more malleable now. Just glimpsing that experience for those few seconds has raised my consciousness to a much higher level than before. I dedicated my life to ascension that very night.

"dt9owju","Let me paint a realistic picture of today (and not someday in the future).

You walk into a coffee shop, no mere Starbucks, as you fancy yourself some Eco fair trade beans from a hipster local Cafe.  You place your order while making small talk with the owner's daughter at the register.  She smiles, you smile, she's probably in to you.  

Your extra medium, extra hip chai latte with extra whip, no milk, extra soy, super steamed, and double cupped beverage is all yours, for the very hipster fair price of $6.85.  

Without missing a beat, you whip out your... phone and proudly show her a QR code.  Cute barista sees your QR and asks you if that's some new version of Apple pay.  You tell her you're all set to pay with BCH, and are taken aback when her face tells you she has no idea what you're on about.  

You rightfully decide it's time to just pay with Fiat like the other dirty savages, but politely ask if you could discuss BCH and how it could help their business save on fees, etc.  She's looking at you with an encouraging gaze at she hands over your change and hipster coffee.

Now's the time, you see that nobody else is in line and start explaining how everything works and then NEXT! You hear her yell out.  Puzzled, you look behind to find nobody else in line, although there is a man in his fifties sipping a tea at a nearby table.  As the barista yells the second, more intense NEXT, you sheepishly walk away while the man at the table slowly shakes his head side to side signaling your defeat.

Your intentions were pure and honest, but unfortunately a small business owner cannot buy coffee cups or coffee, nor can they buy their family food with BCH.

TLDR; You're good intentioned, but wrong.  BCH in the real world (99.9999% of goods and services) cannot be easily convinced to accept a currency that is not readily available to them to immediately spend on other things.

"dt9hrp0","&gt;There are over 1,350 REQs currently unlockable in the game. Of them, only 317 affect gameplay. And even then, they only affect Warzone mode. So let's chill on the ""intrusive"" business.

Being excluded from a gamemode because you don't throw money at the screen or got bad luck with the RNG side of things is still intrusive. I like the idea of warzone i don't like the idea that i have to grind through packs to get a chance at higher tier content. My team was constantly crushed because we didn't have high end content and by the time we were able to start deploying the big guns we had nothing we could deploy. The enemy seemed to always have tons of heavy weapons and vehicles. In a game like Halo this pretty much means victory for the enemy team. Again this means that i can't really have a pleasant experience in Warzone without grinding.


&gt;Less than 550 hours of gameplay at the extreme outside

That's still insane if all i'm after are the good looking pieces of armor. The problem with the REQ system is that it's intentionally bloated with low effort content to make it more grindy for players to unlock anything decent. Even if it only took me 400 hours to get the Armor set i want thats still way too many. I don't want to receive a bunch of crap i won't use (crap that the majority of people would never consider using).

&gt; spend any amount of money, or get lucky on Bronzes,

Luck and spending anything more than the base cost of the game should never be factored into getting the item you want in a Halo game. The only luck based challenge should be whether or not one of your friends fucks up on the vidmaster achievements and costs you all that sweet sweet Recon armor.


&gt;Here's the thing: you are entitled to your own opinion, and you are entitled to express it here, as long as you stay respectful and honest. But always make sure your facts are straight, and always try to be reasonable. Otherwise, someone's going to have to spend way too much of their evening whipping out their spreadsheets to take you to school.

OP's math is wrong. But that does not mean that you ""schooled him"". It merely means the grind is less atrocious then presented and it very much is still excessive and disgusting. It does not invalidate OP's points in anyway. It's intrusive. Customization has been butchered, Warzone is P2W and lootboxes are a plague.

From his experience, he knew his vassals would listen regardless of his volume, for most were true and honest men. Several he judged as honest but he’d not rely upon them with the chips down. Among these was the Roxton. Brother to his Lord, his voice was present, if less than valued.

I will travel to Castamere, by way of Oldtown, for the wedding of my sister and the young Lord Reyne. With me, travels the Master of Coin.” Why the Master of Coin would be there Garth left unsaid. The man might think Garth too risky a horse to saddle after the situation with the King. “Following this, I will return to Highgarden. It is there that I would ask you Lords to gather, in 2 months time. My sisters will be wed on that day, to the Lords Casswell and Florent.” *And I myself to Lora, most like.* “There too we will convene a new Council of the Mander.”

“Mark that you not mistake this council as merely a request. I will expect all my direct vassals to attend, so that we might make sense of the broader Realm and the Reach’s place within it. Two months. For now, safe journeys to you all. Lord Oakheart, Alester, any weapons you need for this ranging of yours will be supplied for you before you make your leave of the city - as was promised.” With that he made to take his leave of the council, with another called for soon after. With any luck, they’d be able to speak much more freely at that gathering.

"dp1pnsq","Oh I'm the idiot.  You're right.  The guy who's tired of seeing gun murders on TV on what seems like a weekly basis so he suggests something to fix it is the idiot.  I suppose I should just give in to the gun lobby and NRA right?

Hell no.  Asking a psych or social worker to accept a level of liability that we hold gun sale reps to isn't asking a lot if you ask me.  Someone selling guns can stop the sale to any person if they have a bad feeling about it, so they already have the right to say ""no, I'm not letting you get one"".  You don't think someone with a degree in how the human brain and how you interact with others has the same ability?

Guns are inanimate objects the same way nukes are.  You're right they are innately neither good nor bad, but it's way too easy for ""bad guys"" to get them, hence why I didn't punish the gun in my instance, I made it harder for someone to get one in the first place.  

Every three years was put into place because that's about how often one has a life changing event, either good or bad.  It's a good platform to start treatment with someone if you need it, or even as a refresher.  Will it stop 100% of gun violence?  No.  Will it give some people the opportunity to get the help they need if they need it.  If you really do believe that it's a mental health problem, why wouldn't going to see someone help?  If it's a mental health problem, why would the current Congress and President make it easier for those with mental illnesses to get firearms in the first place?

I got my experience from working with addicts and dual diagnosis patients.  Most of whom were hooked on either meth, heroin, or prescriptions with mental health issues at the same time (schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc).  I've seen mental health issues and how this country has failed them first hand.  I've seen it with my eyes how people who want help can't get help because rehab is stupidly expensive and hard to get into.  But of all my former clients, only a handful didn't take it seriously.  You had a few who were court mandated, sure, but they had to do it or they went to jail, so they had a reason to go.  Much like these people would have to go if they wanted a firearm.  

It is hard to be open and honest, but unless you are, it's hard for them do do their job.  It's almost as hard for us as it is for the client, because we're the ones having to decide how to move on and whether to continue treatment, taper off treatment, or accelerate.  It was such a thankless job in the end, and when I left, I left happy knowing I did stop one person from suicide.  They called me in tears saying they didn't know if they could go on, I had them taken to the ER (fun fact, if you're suicidal you go to the front of the line).  They found a loaded gun under their pillow, and she got the help she needed.  Now, that being said, that particular client (or case as we called them) would NOT have passed any psych exam to get a gun, and that's just from me knowing her and working her case.  Will some?  Absolutely.  I had one BPD patient almost learn too much about me because they put on a facade, but I was a rookie right out of college then.

Most Psych's are self employed, so they don't get paid unless they see clients.  If they see a legitimate problem, they'll want you to stay both for selfish reasons as well as trying to make you better.  I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm saying it's something.",1509283572,"it is hard to be open and honest, but unless you are, it's hard for them do do their job.","open and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"open and honest","open",NA,NA,0

"doj320t","On-line dating. Forget the stigma of ""computer dating"" of the 90's. If you can't meet a girl through mutual friends (which most people over the age of 23 cannot), on-line is your only option. Tinder, OKCupid, Bumble--it doesn't matter. Do them all if you want.
Make an honest, but flattering, profile. Pick good but honest pics. Don't claim to be more than you are, but don't highlight your faults. Or even mention them. Be concise.
Then take a shot-gun approach to sending out inquiries—aim, but not too precisely. Your message has to make some reference to her profile. Think about how you felt writing your own profile, and how she must feel about each part of her own. Pick the part that you think is the most honest, and comment on it. Anything positive, even if it’s just, “that’s a great observation…” is a point for you.
It shows you read the profile and, if you’re lucky, . If you're a catch, 1/5 might respond. If you're average, 1/10. If you're that kid from Mask and unemployed, maybe 1/100. And of those respond, maybe 1/5 will agree to a date. But you have to ask them. Do it once you've established you can type with decent grammar and aren't a serial killer. Waiting too long is more harmful that doing it too soon.
Of those 1/5 who respond, 3/4 will cancel at the last minute and set a date for the next week. They won't cancel that. They won't show up either, or respond to any message of yours confirming the date. Just let them go, like they never responded.
Now, that one that shows up for the date. Lower your expectations. She'll probably spend the whole time talking about chemtrails. Or order a bunch of pricey drinks and then not even pretend to notice that the bill arrives, then give you a heartless ""thank you"" after you sign the bill.
But—this is key—of those 1/4 who show up, of the 1/5 who responded, of the 1/10 or so to whom you sent individualized messages, 9/10 will agree to a second date if you ask them on the spot—then 0 of the 9 will return any of your messages following through. So, if you must ask her anything, ask if she wants to go to another bar, or back to your place for blow or acid or Adderall or weed, or whatever you have to offer.
It’s best not to offer or ask for any continuing engagement—imply it if you must, but make her make it explicit. Then say you had a great time and open for a hug.
Now, of that 1/4 showed up for the date, 2/4 will reject the hug. Of the 2 that take the hug, send them a text within 12 hours saying you enjoyed meeting them and had fun. If you get a response, quickly follow it up—no more than 3 messages—with a request for a second date. Ask to go to some place she said she liked, if applicable.
Of those 2/4 you asked, 1/4 will say yes. Of these, 1/2 will just be in it for a free meal at their favorite restaurant. Cut your losses and move on. 
Now, of the other 1/2 that agree to a second date, it’s about a 20% chance that you’ll hit it off and start to date, to become one another’s boyfriend and girlfriend.
Of course, of those 20%, about 1/2 will just view you as a “fuck buddy,” which you’ll find out after about six months of thinking you have a girlfriend.
So, in summation, to get a girl-friend you need to find that girl who’s 1/2 of 1/5 of 1/2 of ¼ of ½ of ¼ of ¼ of 1/5 of 1/10 of the girls you sent individualized messages to—assuming you’re an average guy. In other words, just send a thoughtful, individualized message to 127,529 woman on on-line dating sites, and you’ll get a girlfriend.
Yeah, those odds are long. But so are the lottery. And you can’t win if you don’t play.

It makes you feel like you frequently really let them down.

It makes you feel a bit shallow.

I won't give you advise exactly.  I'll just tell you a bit of my story.

In my case I sat myself down and tallied up the amazing things about the person I was with.

Total trust, great heart, bit insane at times but in a cute sort of way :).

The list went on and there just wasn't a negative beyond what you'd expect in a typical, normal and healthy relationship.

She was that good in my eyes.

I just couldn't get past the fact that she had let herself get frumpy, out of shape and unexciting.

She didn't rev me up and that bothered me.

But I invested some time thinking about all the things that I hated, or disliked, or felt ""blah"" about...and I asked myself if they could change if it was approached in a positive way.

In most cases the answer was ""yes"".

So I set about to do everything that I could to change those things in a way that enhanced our relationship.

Getting in shape together, some clothes shopping together, trying some new things with her to push her stubborn comfort zone.

It took a lot of effort but eventually something just seemed to click.  

She improved in some way, which motivated me to do the same...then it snowballed and everything changed in a good way :).

If you think deeply and come to the conclusion that the issues can be fixed then just go for it and see if you can make something of it.  Just do it in an honest but thoughtful way :).

If you think that those negative qualities are fixed, then it may be best to say goodbye rather than draw things out.

"dmivx79","&gt; It's less about treatment than economics. Whites have been able to build up wealth over generations in America in a way that blacks, because of slavery and segregation, have not.

This is a good way of explaining it.

When I spoke of treatment I meant things like open racism, police profiling, not getting loans, workplace discrimination, high incarceration rates, etc. Of course I know blacks are much poorer on average, but this conversation is often fixated on the way they're _thought of_ by society and on their history in this country rather than simply: money is power and they don't have money.

That takes all emotion and subjectivity out of the equation (for me at least) and makes it much easier to re-frame the problem. ∆

&gt; Anyway, privilege does not connote blame.

I understand this. But as you yourself said: 

&gt; But white privilege, the term itself, got under your skin. It's hard to get people's attention when it comes to injustices weighted in their favor - it takes someone who's not just honest but also able to master their emotions and biases. People who can't do that probably aren't going to be moved by someone explaining privilege to them.

So even if it's not ""blame,"" per se, it's still a pejorative or else it wouldn't get under anyone's skin.

"dl0pdxd","Either is probably fine to be honest but how much travel is there in SI?  I used to fly airplanes for a living (until I injured one of my eyes - turns out having both work is pretty important), and was gone frequently - I would actually like traveling around provided I the schedule didn't have me too far from my family.

Ideally working for a facility would probably be the best (because I have a wife and three kids) but working as an integrator and traveling around would be fine if it was on a rotation or something, but I don't even know if that's something places do.  Integration sounds more interesting.!!When I was I pilot I used to work 2-weeks-on-2-weeks-off for awhile and that was pretty freaking awesome and if I could work a rotation like that again I'd be on it.  

Truth is, I'm really open to anything, but ideally one facility would probably be the best from a family standpoint.  From a ""what sounds cool"" standpoint, helping to maintain and automate something like a refinery or a power plant sounds interesting but I imagine SI is the most dynamic.  Up here in AK the pipeline sounds like an awesome place to work, as do the rigs, but my wife is from WI and factory work down there would be cool too - some of the processes on the pulp mills are really complicated, that could be really interesting.  

If there was a way to do SI in Wisconsin or the Midwest in general and not spend so much time away from home that I get divorced I think that would probably be the most fun and interesting.  Doing field service work would be amazing and dynamic and awesome, but I'd suspect I'd need an EE to do that though, yeah?  There was a guy on here who was a tech who moved into the role of setting up controls for about 4 or 5 factories in his local area - something like that would be awesome. 

Honestly - I'm trying to figure out the path still.  What pathway requires the most critical thinking and creativity?  I'd guess SI - but honestly I don't know.  I'd like whatever is the most challenging and creative without resulting in me spending so much time away that it damages my marriage and my relationship with my kids.

"dk9yex1","&gt; Do the LDP advocate for a federal independent commision against corruption?

Honest answer: Not sure.

Here's the thing: Who will lead the commission? Who selects the people on panel making selections? Are these people honest, or do they have a political agenda? What power will these people have? Can these people be threatened and/or blackmailed?

The idea is okay, but the implementation is hard.

For me going forward, I think the best thing we can do is make the government as most transparent as it can be. All invoices, bills, the ledger of payments, contracts, etc should be made electronically available and searchable with APIs that let the public easily access the information.

Additionally, all corporate welfare should be halted, and the playing field should be levelled with regard to banking, land development, telecommunications, etc. 

If the above is done, it'd remove a lot of the incentives for corruption, and it'd also provide checks and balances which the public could enforce.

"dh4wd4e","&gt;  People are losing their shit about Amazon Echoes, Drones, Webcam hacking, ISPs being able to sell our search history in the real world. But in The Circle, people and governments not only consent to their craziness, they celebrate and applause its genius.

I'd have to disagree with you there. There is without question concern over personal security and certainly devices like Amazon Echo and Drones contribute to that concern. But when it comes to the big companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., I feel like they wouldn't be as big and successful as they are if the masses weren't willing to hand over their personal information in exchange for modern luxuries and conveniences. Sure they might complain about it...but how many of those people still have Facebook? How many still opt for vanilla Google over a Tor? How many still order things online? How many still apply for a job online (the fact that there is rarely an alternative with so many companies is serious bullshit to be honest, but different topic).

The society portrayed in The Circle is probably easy to mock given we are a cynical &amp; ironic culture in real life and we make fun of just about everything that doesn't satisfy us immediately, but when you take a step back and look at our own behaviors I think you'd find that we aren't so concerned with our privacy as you think we would be. I mean, sure we all want/expect privacy, but the nuanced way technologies ask us to surrender that privacy is so easy to overlook for most people. Especially when you intrigue them with clever marketing and poppy advertisements telling you how simple and easy it is to sign up for whatever new ""social experience"" is in question.

"dgemg14","Well with confession I meant how it's wide spread and commonplace. I believe most churches you can go and confess. But it's certainly not common. And there is a difference in confessing to a friend, and confessing with someone who has been trained for that. With friends it can be very hard to be sincere and honest, but with a priest you can really dig deep down in what you regret and are ashamed and be granted that forgiveness and given that peace. It's incredible.

When it comes to the gold and cathedrals. We could scrap everything and give it to the poor absolutely. But when Jesus was anointed with oil that cost about a years worth of wages, Judas (yes that Judas) condemned the woman who was doing so and requested it be sold so the money could be given to the poor (which as the treasurer, he would have been able to keep it). Jesus then scolded him and said ""the poor will always be among you."" Combine this with historical worship not just with Christianity but with Jews. Money should not be diverted from the poor to pay for these things. But there is nothing wrong with helping the poor and offering our best in honor of God. Because we do things like incense and expensive oils as a way of giving God our all. 

In addition things like these have attracted many people to Christ. Including myself. Seeing Cathedrals, the traditions, and all that is ornate made me see it as something more serious. Consider the ceiling of the Sistine chapel. It's basically a big way of honoring God. But the Catholic church is one of the largest charities in both volunteer time and money donated. The Church does an incredible amount of Good too.

I think some churches will be better than others. I think it's entirely possible to have a bad church. And since the Catholic Church believes itself to have an authority beyond other churches, it's kind of hard to see ourselves as one of everyone else. Since that's not our belief. 

There are a lot of cultural catholics, and some weird traditions in latin america, asia and africa. But ultimately it is united. The universalness of the church comes from it not being a church just of the jews, not of the rich, not of the men, it's a church for everyone.

As for transvaginal ultrasounds, I'm about to have baby #2 and I've never had one. They've all been abdominal. You can always request that they attempt abdominal first. You do have the option to ask. With some women they need to use the vaginal transducer, but it's not guaranteed. I always ask for abdominal first. If it didn't work, of course I'd go with the vaginal, but they haven't needed to use it in my case. 

Cervical checks are really optional, except for when you're giving birth. I think they're very important when you're giving birth though. You gotta know when to push! Lol. 

There's no harm in asking your doctor questions or assessing your options is my point. My OB told me, when I asked to delay my pap till after birth, that I should always feel comfortable asking questions and discussing what I want with her.

"dcdpakf","&gt; This isn't a case of, oh poor CNN, getting bullied by Trump. No, they're both assholes.

I agree.

The issue is that while all Presidents and other public servants do the above, as you said, Trump takes it a step further. Rather than just selecting questions, he's actively trying to control how the media covers him; if you don't cover him positively and kiss his boots, he'll try to revoke your press privileges and drag you and your outlet through the dirt.

There are bad things about the media, to be sure, but there are also good things. Having a free press is critical to the success of a democracy; right now Trump is trying to suppress media outlets who are asking honest but unfavorable questions, which is something that no other president has done.

If you need examples: The Washington Post ordeal during the campaign is a prime example. He accused them of covering him unfairly; they invited him to sit down and talk to explain his exact positions; all they got was the exact drivel he'd be spewing over the previous few weeks and when they reported that as he said it, he further accused them of mis-reporting what he said.

That's how he gets the power he wants, by claiming that he's really not that crazy and the press is just unfairly covering him, which people eat up because people already dislike the press. The issue is that if you look at unbiased or international sources, he still looks batshit crazy and makes the same unsubstantiated claims when they report directly on what he says.",1484324267,"having a free press is critical to the success of a democracy; right now trump is trying to suppress media outlets who are asking honest but unfavorable questions, which is something that no other president has done.","honest but unfavorable","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but unfavorable","unfavorable",NA,NA,1

You are still very very new and might not even have made it on the highway/interstate yet. A bit of apprehension is normal and healthy because you can really screw up on a bike.

You will find plenty of pictures of road rash. Should I post a picture of my ass after hours touring with no incidents? Of course not.

Yes there is a greater risk riding a bike. It can be reduced by not being an idiot and practicing and taking advanced courses. Take it slow.

And if it remains to much... well there is a reason a lot of bikes are on sale with barely any miles on them. If the fear isn't apprehension and is going to remain and affect your riding then maybe it is better to stop. 

Only you can determine if the fear itself is making riding dangerous (unable to focus on traffic, holding the handlebars rigidly, stopping in the middle of traffic).

"dallzek","I've written a version of this before, but I'm not sure it's that simple. This narrative on Reddit is very common, but I think it's problematic in a lot of ways.

&gt;The right has had an active 30 year Clinton Hate campaign against her and her husband. 

True, but there's a hard question to be asked there about the degree to which Hillary should be held responsible for Bill's personal or political issues.

&gt;Fox News was literally created in 1996 to have a full time Clinton Hate Network.

Sort of. The thing that has always bothered me about the left's absolute contempt for Fox is that Fox is actually right about the degree to which the news establishment leans Democrat. We can argue about whether Fox is also right that this results in biased or irresponsible journalism, but I don't think there's a legitimate argument to be made that 95% of a profession voting Democrat will have *no impact whatsoever* on how it covers politics.

I would argue that most journalists are reasonable and honest, but their overall lack of familiarity with Republican demographics and voting patterns can and does result in serious problems, e.g., the reporting on the 2012 primaries and the degree of coverage Michelle Bachmann received over Ron Paul, or, hell, even the 2016 race. Trump got endless media coverage. Republicans with more level-headed platforms did not.

&gt;The Democratic leadership completely jumped off a cliff thinking she was capable of the Obama levels of motivation among Millennials simply because she was a woman. Wrong. Millennials on the whole wanted Bernie's ideas and progress, not a conservative version of Obama.

Sanders won white millennials, but that was about it. Even if every single superdelegate had gone for Bernie, he still would have lost. And polling best with the age demographic *least* likely to vote is a pretty significant problem to overcome. As we all learned on Election Day, the number of people who say they support you is ultimately irrelevant, but who gets their ass to the voting booth is not. 

Tossing over Hillary in favor of Bernie might have created some pretty severe long-term problems for the Democrats. Bernie has never been a Democrat (although he does caucus with them) and his decision to became one was purely political. You need the help of one of two major parties in American politics to have a realistic shot at the presidency (or, more cynically, influencing the last man standing's platform). If the DNC had decided that Bernie was the more marketable candidate and thrown more support to him, you would have had the ugly specter of the DNC screwing over a woman who'd been a Democrat for 35+ years and campaigned on behalf of Democratic candidates and causes in favor of a white dude who went HEY I GUESS I'M A DEMOCRAT NOW in fall 2015 and wanted their campaign/transition teams and donor base.

I think we can all agree that -- at best -- that would have been a problematic message to send to the Democratic constituency.

&gt;They forgot Obama was an outsider who beat Hillary back in 2008.

Barely. It was an incredibly close primary. [Hillary actually won the popular vote but still lost the race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2008). Sound familiar?

There's a big part of me that wonders if we would have been better off with Hillary winning the 2008 primary and Obama running again 4-8 years later. Trump isn't guaranteed to run in this timeline, but his campaign picked up a lot of steam from ""Lock her up."" It would have been very hard for Trump (or any other Republican candidate) to get anything worthwhile to stick to Obama.",1480479592,"i would argue that most journalists are reasonable and honest, but their overall lack of familiarity with republican demographics and voting patterns can and does result in serious problems, e.g., the reporting on the 2012 primaries and the degree of coverage michelle bachmann received over ron paul, or, hell, even the 2016 race.","reasonable and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"reasonable and honest","reasonable",NA,NA,0

"d8mud4m","I had to rewrite a pretty long response because after rereading it I felt like a dick so this time I'm gonna be more civil. Still gonna be honest but less of an asshole. Ok so I disagree with some things in this list. I feel like Xanax is such a complex drug with many variables like different kinds(white/green/yellow), and different doses, and different tolerances, and how everyone reacts to it differently. I know you can say this about all drugs but that is kind of my point. To make a list that assumes all users are alike does not work. A new user that is very skinny is effected very differently from 2mg compared to an experienced overweight user. It's very hard for me to agree with your don't exceed 2mg per 8 hours when that might work with someone who is a very infrequent user, but for someone who has a script or uses a good amount, 2mg is just enough to have less anxiety, no where near a high. So we need more in the area of 6-10mg compared on the user and the color of the bar to feel the same the infrequent users do on 2mg. So overall, I would rephrase the 2mg per 8 hours max to whatever is a medium dose for you per twice a day max IF you want to stay not addicted. Max at one time I would say 10-14mg (could be different, it depends on your tolerance and stuff) just so you can remember things and stay awake. I would say for the alcohol, I think drinking with benzos rocks, but be careful. If I am taking a good dose of benzos like 6-10mg I would only drink somewhere around 4-8 shots. But see that might sound crazy for some people. For some people maybe 2-4 shots with 2mg might be best. Alcohol and benzos are fun but you can die if you mix too much of them. I agree with not texting your ex, but I also extend that to not texting anyone other than people you need to and even then being carful maybe have people monitor you while you text. Do not drive on benzos unless you have a script or use a lot  and your only driving on low doses. Get rides from friends if you want to go somewhere. If you start to have problems with stealing, do it with friends and tell them to make sure you don't. Idk from my experience you can mix xannies with almost everything else and be fine except for large amounts of alcohol or opiates. .5mg literally does nothing to me so that doesn't work. More like don't do more than 4mg maybe 2-3 of you wanna be safe. You can't just not lust over it, you can't force your brain to not think about the perfect high. Learn to accept the lust and control it. Have certain food set out before hand. Less snacks more meals and you'll be chill. Overall not too bad of a list I just thought I'd add my opinion.

It wasn't #1 when I posted this; that's why as I wrote in the heading that it was 'temporary.' 

Please re-read the full description I wrote in the AMA; it outlines all this: ""The book hit #1 in the Science Fiction category on Sept 10, stayed through most of Sept 11, then started to slip. It's still in the Top 20 and still free, at the below link. I can answer questions about the process I took to help it get to #1.""

Dude, I realize not every vet out there is honest, but most of them are and I am. I had a successful 21 year military career, then retired with disability overseas for a bit. Now taking time to learn new things. So I would never sabotage my writing career by posting something dishonest or incorrect; that would do the opposite of what I'm attempting. I did a Masters in Writing in order to get better, so I could start doing this. I wouldn't throw it away.

I even took a screenshot which is posted on my (under construction) sci-fi blog about antagonists. It is here:

This is me attempting a neutral opinion. Telling me to fuck off back to my own sub isn't terribly constructive...not that you have, just blunting the easy counter-comment.)

I have said this in /r/nfl, and I think it bears repeating here....McCoy isn't getting fired until the Chargers final destination is resolved. You should *not* have blown that lead. Not in a million years. An entire half of prevent defense plus continued strength and conditioning bullshit that this regime has had caused the downfall from having a very winnable game turning into hoping the Raiders lost (wtf Big Balls Del Rio)...which inevitably turned into wishing death on McCoy. He's been outmatched from the very beginning. Every week its ""we'll fix this in practice."" Fix what exactly? The fact the team doesn't seem to give a fuck about playing all four quarters? The fact your conditioning staff apparently is actively *trying* to get players injured when you have one of the best QBs of this century at the helm (be it Brees or Rivers)? Or is it that you just don't give a fuck and know eventually you'll be fired so hey, here's a paycheck?

I really think that McCoy is the fall guy when the Spanos' ""exhaust"" their options and move to Los Angeles. Clean slate right? Now we can start fresh in Los Angeles (where we self-admitted a quarter of our fanbase is and we assume the other three-quarters can tell us to fuck off and we'll be fine). We'll hire a real coach and hope the team is just good enough in a Stan Kroneke-owned stadium to sell to some sucker for twice its SD value and get the fuck out of sports ownership, ideally for eternity.

In all seriousness, and I imagine some of you agree with this, its better when the division as a whole is good and its a smashmouth ""we're sending 3 teams to the playoffs"" group than when 1 or more teams are garbage. Dean Spanos is just continually proving he doesn't give two fucks about the product he's putting out in San Diego because he has his eyes set on the dollar signs in LA. That referendum isn't passing, and to ensure it playing like shit with a coach like McCoy all but guarantees the move.

What ""established"" news outlets remain that are fairly neutral? NPR seems to have a slight liberal bias (which appeals to me, to be honest), but I feel they're still trying very hard to remain neutral. The BBC?

Most of my information (and frankly, speculation) about Hillary's health condition comes from right wing ""alt-media"", and I hate myself a little for patronizing them, but I couldn't find any information on it anywhere else. What triggered my curiosity, ironically, was a segment on Stephen Colbert where they showed the videos of her having seizures or tremors, and they tried to downplay it as ""excitement"". When I saw the video however, I knew that it wasn't normal. I had heard before that the alt-right media was trying to craft this conspiracy theory about her failing health. But now it's getting very difficult to deny that there's something wrong. The thing, if she would be open and honest about it, it probably wouldn't be that big of a deal. Or better yet, the Democrats could have picked a better candidate when there was still time.

"d6yvd71","Mumbai underworld was ruled by the Pathans and Afghans from the beginning. It was like an unique ecosystem. In the beginning, there were gangs based on region, there used to Bhaiya log ka gang also. It was before Haji Mastan era. What Haji Mastan did was actually taking the underworld to another level. Thanks to INC's economic policies - Foreign liquor, gold, watches everything was to be smuggled. Haji Mastan gave a it a systematic form. All of the economy of various basti(localities) depended on smuggling and illicit liquor. 

Then Mastan was in good terms with Karim lala and Vardrajan. Now in Dongri area, all the Afghans and Pathans had good hold. Dawood's father was an honest but poor Police constable but he was also having cordial relations with Karim lala, Mastan etc - like ghar me aana jaana. Dawood got fascinated by his experiences and he formed a local gang, He grew stronger because he started using brains in a better way than the other next gen gangsters. An honest journalist was his friend, who was murdered, Dawood avenged him. Would you believe?

Dawood ousted a significant gangster, right hand of karim Lala, I guess simply by attacking him and his goons with Hundreds of Soda bottles. 

Division of underworld on religious lines happened much later. In fact Survey was hired for murdering Kaskar brothers by Afghani Pathans. 

Underworld was secularised after 1993 Bombings. Chhota Rajan defended Dawood at first and attacked Thakrey but he was being  sidelined by Chhota Shakeel. Eventually he was to be finished off one day in Dubai but he got the tip, ended up in Indian embassy to get rid of threat to his life and then he was escorted to South East Asia overnight by RAW. Since then Chhota Rajan has been a tool of Indian Agencies. Still he never ended up in good books of Thackrey who called Hindu gangsters as Aamche Mulge famously but did not count Chhota Rajan among them .

The way OP puts up the title, I disagree. It was Shivsena and Thackrey who secularised the Mumbai underworld. Chhota Rajan was No-2 in Dawood's gang all the time, Sharad Shetty continued with Dawood till his death.

"d4q31va","Is this for a class or just for fun project? If it's for class, I would do more than just flipping the background of the original art and then placing Roy and Lilina on top of it, which was also taken from the original art.

However, I do commend you properly aligning elements, placement is key to good design. I'd also suggest using the same black outline for the subtext as you did for ""The Continent of Elibe is At War"", as the words start getting drowned out by the background near the middle and end, but not near the beginning where the background is a solid brown. Personally, I wouldn't choose that font because it is weirdly elongated in contrast to the Fire Emblem logo, the two fonts are fine separately, but together they seem to clash.

Others have said that there is too much text in the back, this is both true and false. These days, video game box art has very minimal amounts of text other than describing gameplay, take example the Fire Emblem: Awakening box art. Back then, however, box art had much more text like those in a majority of Gameboy Advance games. If you are designing for this era, you'd want less.

"d4ixhxa","&gt;7.  if you really aren't meshing with your counselor, don't be afraid to get another one (but if it's painful only because of the topics and the solutions you are working on, it's probably best to push through!  counselors should be honest but supportive)

I think everything in your post is good heartfelt advice, including this one, but I want to strongly make the opposite emphasis, and say that if something doesn't feel right with the therapist, get the hell out of there and find a new one. 

I've had the unfortunate/fortunate experience of seeing many many therapists over my lifetime, from the time I was 10 years old to the newest one I saw a year ago at the age of 48. 

I've had very good ones, and I've seen some ones that were simply incompatible with me. 

What is important to remember is that therapists are people, too. They have their own experiences, their own strengths and weaknesses, and they come into the sessions with their own set of biases. 

I've seen/heard about homosexuals who saw therapists who felt that homosexuality was a sin. I've seen/heard of therapists who felt like pharmaceutical solutions were wrong, or alternatively, that pharmaceutical solutions were a necessity. 

I'll give you my two best personal examples from my own experiences where I was seeing the wrong person.  

The first is when I was a teenager having difficulties in school. This is in the 80s when ADHD wasn't nearly as common a diagnosis. The therapist I saw accused me of purposefully sabotaging the sessions because I was regularly late. I was flummoxed by this, because I didn't feel like I was trying to sabotage the sessions at all. I was honestly trying my best to seek help. The sense of rejection from him hurt my feelings in damaging ways to the therapeutic process, and it wasn't a message I was willing to internalize, because I knew I was late for everything, and that I had some very real and painful issues with dealing with time - something we all know is practically ubiquitous for ADHD people, but at the time wasn't commonly associated with any popular term. 

In any case, this therapist had a very antagonistic approach with me throughout the sessions. He was simply the wrong therapist for me, and trying to push through that would have been extremely damaging. 

The other one was a sex therapist I saw a few years ago. After several sessions where I basically paid her to listen to my sexual history, she basically started in about how all my issues revolved around unresolved problems with my mother, which I strongly disagreed with. After asking some more questions I figured out she was educated at a specific center where this was a common philosophy taught as central part of the curriculum. I eventually found some other issues which turned out to be more pertinent to the problems I was experiencing, and ended up being fine. Because of her biases, if I had continued seeing her, I feel like I would have gone down a rabbit hole, that very well could have messed me up far worse. 

I've had many positive experiences, too. What I learned is that while a positive therapeutic experience can be painful, it shouldn't necessarily feel forced. The right therapist is going to ask questions to guide the path. There's going to be some ability to be sympathetic, without becoming your friend. There shouldn't be evidence of an agenda which goes against your core beliefs. 

Unfortunately, because therapy is so painful, and puts us in a position where we're inherently at our most vulnerable, it's not something we really want to duplicate over and over again in an effort to find the ""right"" one. In addition, therapy is not something people usually have a great deal of experience with, so there's no comparisons readily available to know when something is a positive therapeutic experience versus one that's not going to be helpful, and in worse case scenarios, potentially damaging. 

My best advice is that a good therapist should feel like a fit, and a bad combination will have a sense of awkwardness that can't be shaken. Trust your instincts on some level. Don't try to force the issue. There are a lot of therapists out there. One of them is the right one for you. Don't settle for someone who is going to create an experience that isn't going to help with your issues.

I think she has always been a combat medic, I believe I proved this a long time ago. The problem with every single sunflower player I've watched is that they don't know when to back off. The think that just because they've pushed the other team a bit, they can handle everything that's thrown at them and they get cocky and die. You have to think at least 3 steps ahead when you play the sunflower. You managed to help your team get in the capture point and you even solar flared a couple of enemies?

"d3wqz12","lol. I had mentioned to him that he ought to include writing in the trailer too, but he said it just interrupted the flow of everyting in such a way that he decided against including it. That sounds like kind of a BS reason to me personally. :V

But a better reason might be that what makes the writing good is something that's hard to get across in a few seconds. Like... have you read Game of Thrones? You can say what you want about the plot, but the writing (especially in the first two books; his editor deserves a ton of credit for how well the writing came out) is really gorgeous. There will be a single sentence that just sounds beautiful, and you could show off that one sentence and get a feel for the whole book.

I think my brother's writing isn't like that. It's all dialogue, and what makes it good (imo, anyway) is how believable and honest the characters feel. They're all interacting and reacting to things. All the wisecracks feel like things people would really say in that situation; not ""HEY WE NEED A JOKE HERE.""

"d2xg3aa","By that logic, nothing with a finite range of states could be capable of being random. A roll of a perfectly balanced die isn't random. That's clearly not true. 

By random, what is meant is that we can't predict when the event will occur. This is randomness, unless you're defining random as an event that could have truly unlimited results. e.g. does my die only become random if, instead the traditional result of a number in the range of 1 to 6, it could give me a chocolate seagull? 

I think this is largely unrelated to the discussion of agency and free will. The behaviour at any given level can be different to layers above and below. That particles at the quantum level can wink in or out of existence doesn't mean that the same is true at the atomic level. The reason I responded to that point because it does not follow that randomness does away with physical laws and the current thinking on randomness would accept that there is indeed randomness at the quantum level. 

If we want to understand agency then we'd probably look more to sciences focussed on humans and their behaviours. It's already pretty well evidenced that agency can be messed with through manipulation of variables in experiments. You can manipulate people and, if asked why they made the decision, they will give entirely honest but incorrect rationales. In particular, there's a lot of interesting stuff going in neurology and psychology in trying to understand how free will works - if at all.

"d2qkvxr","Nope to me socially awkward is actually being socially awkward. I find it's just generally guys who label being awkward around gals as socially awkward.

My attraction is based on looks so I likely can't really do the difference in behaviour and mentality between a socially awkward guy I'm not attracted to and a confident man that I am. As the behavior/mentality is no difference in attraction to me.

I can do the difference in the behavior and mentality I see from a confident guy.

Guy who is socially awkward around gals vs confident guy: 

1. The guy who is socially awkward around gals generally don't see gals as human beings but some other who is denying him sex/date/whatever that he deserves or is entitled to have. While the confident guys see gals as human beings they could have sex with or date if they're compatible. 

2. The guy who is socially awkward around gals generally is more egoistical thinking his only possible flaw is being too nice and that gals are too stuckup, slutty, or stupid to choose him. While the confident guys knows he has flaws that gals may not like but whatevas as there are plenty of gals who may like him.

3. The socially awkward around gals guy doesn't read hints, facial expressions, body language, or social context as he normally would when in the same/similar scenario with guys. Instead his desire to fuck/date/whatever a gal influences his perception and he projects what he wants onto the gal. Such as a gal being friendly is seen as flirting with him because he thinks the only reason a gal would pay attention to him is for sexual/romantic interest since that's why he'd only pay attention to a gal. While the confident guy reads hints, social cues, body language, and facial expressions to determine a gal's motive/intent in her words and actions.

4. The socially awkward around gals guy will dismiss or belittle a gal feeling unsafe or uncomfortable around him and claim she's only calling him creepy because he's not hot. Then he'll proceed to rant about it telling her what boundaries she can and can't have. I find most socially awkward around gals guys will only see very extreme stuff as creepy ie it has to be borderline psycho serial rapist stalker to be creepy. While the confident guy will recognize he overstepped her boundary if he doesn't think it's a logical one and will either apologize or just back off. He may not think he was creepy but it's not him the words/actions were done to and it's not him who determines whether she feels uncomfortable/unsafe.

5. The socially awkward around gals guy sees interaction as some game where if he does the right things she'll give him what he wants. There's always an end goal it's never just relating to gals as people or friends. Doing that is seen as being 'used' as an emotional tampon if sex is not exchange. It's as if gals are a hivemind and the members are interchangeable and replaceable. While the confident guy sees interaction as just that with a dash of if the gal is up for it and meets his criteria then it can lead to a fuck/date/whatever. He can related to gals as friends if they share interests and hobbies. He may want to fuck them but if they aren't into it then it doesn't phase him as he wants their friendship more than fucking them. Not fucking them and being a friend isn't some prison for them because to him a fuck would be a bonus.

6. The socially awkward around gals guys generally want a 'chance'. It's as if they want a gal that meets their criteria but only want to offer her what he thinks she should desire. If she wants something else then she should give him a 'chance' and she'll see what she wanted was 'wrong' and he truly knows what's best for her. I find this particularly the case with looks- they approach by looks but what the gal to see past his looks for his personality and give him a chance. While the confident guy generally seeks gals who meet his criteria and whose criteria he meets. He's generally okay with being treated as how he treats gals- he approaches by looks so he's cool getting rejected by looks.

There's just so much more.

Genuinely socially awkward guy:

1. Genuinely socially awkward guy lacks knowledge of social skills, social cues, hints, facial expressions, and body language. When he fucks up he acknowledges it and is actually in my opinion excessively apologetic about it and wants to ensure it never happens again. While the confident guy doesn't lack knowledge of social skills, social cues, hints, facial expressions, and body language.

2. Genuinely socially awkward guy lacks tact and will say honest but possible hurtful shit.

"d2cct7y","I think its a delicate balance. There was a quote I found in high school that I started living by, something to the effect of how we should view every person as lovingly and as reverently as we would before the gates of hell. I believe in being honest and vulnerable with others, because I want them to feel safe to do the same with me. I think so much mental anguish in our society is the result of not being honest, feeling like there are things we should hide, and that there is something wrong with us. Its important to know who you are giving that information to though and the manner that it is being delivered. It can tear down barriers between people, or give them control. Some people are not safe to be honest with and we have to preserve some of those boundaries so they don't use it against us. Sometimes we are the ones with that power and the duty falls on us to use it tactfully. 

Be honest, but know what information the other person DOESN'T need to hear. If knowing the details of a transgression will cause them more pain, then don't do that. Tell them what happened, but not all of the sordid details if those details are unnecessary and not truly productive. Like all things, its a grey area. Be honest in your interactions, but know when is the right time and the right way to exercise that, and always be mindful of the impact you have on others.",1461280169,"i believe in being honest and vulnerable with others, because i want them to feel safe to do the same with me.","honest and vulnerable","honest",NA,FALSE,"honest and vulnerable","vulnerable",NA,NA,1

Mockery could be compassionate in some situations, I suppose, but it is definitely not ""what Zen comes to.""

If mockery is the end point, then you are taking something that is infinite and trying to put it into something that is finite. This is the definition of pain.

Zen doesn't come to mockery. Zen comes to compassion. Compassion is a word that leaves it in a loop. Mockery leaves Zen broken in a bad and damaged way, and Zen cannot be broken. Calling it mockery breaks yourself, not the other way around.

If there is something that needs to be destabilized along the way, that's fine. If a moment of mockery is how it happens, fine. But realize that that is always within in the context of the seeker's desire for enlightenment. The mockery cannot be bigger than the student's desire to learn. If it is bigger than the seeker, then you are damaging the other person and yourself.

"czgkrkl","&gt; Well, to get this honest but unpleasant business over, the objection to the Suffragettes is not that they are Militant Suffragettes. On the contrary, it is that they are not militant enough. A revolution is a military thing; it has all the military virtues; one of which is that it comes to an end. Two parties fight with deadly weapons, but under certain rules of arbitrary honor; the party that wins becomes the government and proceeds to govern. The aim of civil war, like the aim of all war, is peace. Now the Suffragettes cannot raise civil war in this soldierly and decisive sense; first, because they are women; and, secondly, because they are very few women. But they can raise something else; which is altogether another pair of shoes. They do not create revolution; what they do create is anarchy; and the difference between these is not a question of violence, but a question of fruitfulness and finality. Revolution of its nature produces government; anarchy only produces more anarchy. Men may have what opinions they please about the beheading of King Charles or King Louis, but they cannot deny that Bradshaw and Cromwell ruled, that Carnot and Napoleon governed. Someone conquered; something occurred. You can only knock off the King's head once. But you can knock off the King's hat any number of times. Destruction is finite, obstruction is infinite: so long as rebellion takes the form of mere disorder (instead of an attempt to enforce a new order) there is no logical end to it; it can feed on itself and renew itself forever. If Napoleon had not wanted to be a Consul, but only wanted to be a nuisance, he could, possibly, have prevented any government arising successfully out of the Revolution. But such a proceeding would not have deserved the dignified name of rebellion. 

&gt; It is exactly this unmilitant quality in the Suffragettes that makes their superficial problem. The problem is that their action has none of the advantages of ultimate violence; it does not afford a test. War is a dreadful thing; but it does prove two points sharply and unanswerably—numbers, and an unnatural valor. One does discover the two urgent matters; how many rebels there are alive, and how many are ready to be dead. But a tiny minority, even an interested minority, may maintain mere disorder forever. There is also, of course, in the case of these women, the further falsity that is introduced by their sex. It is false to state the matter as a mere brutal question of strength. If his muscles give a man a vote, then his horse ought to have two votes and his elephant five votes. The truth is more subtle than that; it is that bodily outbreak is a man's instinctive weapon, like the hoofs to the horse or the tusks to the elephant. All riot is a threat of war; but the woman is brandishing a weapon she can never use. There are many weapons that she could and does use. If (for example) all the women nagged for a vote they would get it in a month. But there again, one must remember, it would be necessary to get all the women to nag. And that brings us to the end of the political surface of the matter. The working objection to the Suffragette philosophy is simply that overmastering millions of women do not agree with it. I am aware that some maintain that women ought to have votes whether the majority wants them or not; but this is surely a strange and childish case of setting up formal democracy to the destruction of actual democracy. What should the mass of women decide if they do not decide their general place in the State? These people practically say that females may vote about everything except about Female Suffrage.

Biblical Criticism *is* ""the controversy* in this case.

They discuss it there as well. But I'm sure anyone who doesn't study Bible at college is unlikely to encounter it ever. Most people simply don't care.

"cycevf9","It's their self-image issues and they see a reflection of themselves when they look at you, so they don't want to see you change. You can stand up to them and say no-thanks.

You CAN change. You can do it. The thing is to *NOT* call it a diet, because it really isn't. Its a new way of looking at food and eating, so it's actually a *lifestyle change*. You just need to cut back on stuff that's not so good, and have more of what is. I use the 50-25-25 division in my head for my plate. 50% vegetables, 25% meat, 25% carbs. Also, don't 'pack' food on your plate, put it on loosely and don't fill it to the edge, leave at least a 1/2"" or so ring around the edge.. looks like more than it is that way. Optical illusion too, if you can pick a smaller plate or bowl.

Read up on your own away from your family and get an idea of what an approximate serving of some things they eat has in calories. I aim for between 1500-1800 calories a day to try and lose 1-2 lbs a month, knowing I can't do much additional exercise. If you can exercise, take long walks etc, you'd lose weight quick at that level, and could even go with a higher calorie range. 

I don't know anything about you, I'm just sharing some of my experience, so you can glean what you may find helpful to you...I wish anyone who wants to better themselves success, and it angers me to see their family try to sabotage that!!! 

First step is to write down what you do eat, and realize how many calories you take in - even if it's just an honest, but close approximation. Then, cut that down, 10-15 percent every couple weeks, along with drinking more water, so you don't feel like you're starving as you adjust to eating less, until you reach your goal intake. I slowly reduced how much I ate over time, so I now literally cannot eat large servings without getting sick, as my stomach shrunk by itself. I had not gotten to be like some of these people who could eat a couple pizzas, plus a couple burgers and fries by themselves in one go, so I had no problem with getting my system to adjust over time without surgery.

You have to change your relationship with food for this to work for the long haul. You have to ask yourself when you pick up that piece of candy, that cookie, that snack cake ""am I eating this because I'm hungry, because I just want it, or because something happened and I feel ______? 

There's an answer to each of these questions. If you're hungry... there's another choice, one that's better than sugary, high fat, high calorie food, that's more nutritious - like fruit, or cut up veggies. If you just want it... fine, then think about how much you're going to eat, and what else you plan to eat that day, so you don't over-eat. 

This idea can work with ""parent pressure"" too... say you know you're going to mom's later in the week... so you eat light with lots of veggies etc the several days before, so your overall calorie ""average"" for the week is low - knowing you're going to splurge on a couple cookies - planning on taking a couple to appease her (and stick with just two!) and knowing they're likely to have some hugely caloric dinner, that you'll deal with with some plan... that way... when you average the calories over the week.... it's not such a big impact on your overall goal. I've done this when I wanted to have pizza one day... I ate a bit less a couple other days... and it seemed to make the pizza splurge not make my weight spike noticably.

If it's the third question and you're going to eat it because something happened and you feel _____... then you need to stop, put it down, and decide what else you can do about how you feel besides ""medicate"" those feelings with food. How about listen to some music? Take a walk, call someone, talk to your pet about whatever it is, just to vent, write in a journal etc... whatever it takes to *not* eat that food to fix the feelings.

I'm guilty of ""emotional eating""....which is what the above is... yep... caught myself at it... and did it... and at least fessed up to myself that I was doing it... and then got back on the wagon the next day. 

I'm 5'4"" and I started out at 240 way back when...I've lost 55 lbs since 2007... I've managed to lose the last 15 since i had my knee replaced 21 months ago, and I'm 43 now and I was 186 yesterday. It's been slow with my health issues, and the car wreck 7 months ago, but I keep trying, a little at a time. I gain a bit back every now and then, or don't lose any at all for a bit... but that's okay...I just keep working at it. I'm not petite, never will be a ""skinny minnie"" and Im okay with that. I'm not a small framed person, I have a larger frame bone structure, even according to the docs. I'm just working on a healthier me, with less unneeded padding in some places!

"cy6t8qr","First of all, maybe your being her sole parental role model did shape her gender identity. Who knows, there's still tons of research trying to figure out exactly what causes gender dysmorphia- but is that a bad thing? No. Because being transgender isn't a bad thing. It's also speculated this can happen with gay men who have a stronger positive female role model in their lives, and that still doesn't really make being gay bad or how they were raised wrong. 

Second of all, it's not *your*  fault she had no positive male influence in her life. That's her father's fault, and you were correct to point out all his mother's fault if he raised him with enough problems to be a criminal and treat his children without acceptance and support. They are wrong, and who cares how Claire ""became"" (I say ""became"" because I'm pretty sure people who are transgender are born with it, or at least born with aspects that can develop into transgenderism- I'm sure she's always been this way and your positive influence helped her feel more comfortable with it and look up to women) transgender. The fact of the matter is, she is, and that is totally fine. 

Just be glad they relayed this information to you and not your daughter. Transitioning can be very difficult and sometimes traumatic. I am happy to hear she has such a positive outlook on life, this will get her far and help her accept herself when others refuse. My advice? Tell them good, because you have the upper hand here and you do not need them. Tell them *you* will not let *them* see your daughter until *they* accept her, not the other way around. 

As for discussing this with your daughter, I think this is a subject that should be approached lightly and in a healthy way. You should be able to be open and honest with your daughter without sacrificing her feelings- this is going to be a difficult balance to accomplish but I think it can be done. Your daughter is 16 and has outwardly felt this way since she was 11- she is probably somewhat prepared for a world that is not ready to accept her. While there is nothing wrong with her, I highly recommend you get her into therapy if she isn't already in it. Transgender people are subjected to some of the most heinous and hateful discrimination in modern society and no matter how strong she is she needs and even stronger support system. Being in therapy will help her work through her feelings when you gently tell her that the world is not as accepting as you and her are- this includes her family and her own father. I stress on gently telling her this. Keep the details to a minimum, but be honest with her. Open the doors for further support and comfort and make sure she has a healthy network of support and coping mechanisms to work through this. 

I will leave you with a story from my best friend who is a lesbian with a very conservative family. When she first came out to her parents they weren't the best about it, and did quite a bit of damage themselves. Over the course of about 2 years, they slowly accepted their daughter and became some of the most wonderful and amazing parents an LGBT person could want for. When she came out the the rest of her family, they acted similarly to her parents initial shock but never really came around. However, her parents protected her. They fought for her and they defended her. They took the brunt of the hatred and relayed the events to her later in a gentler way. They were honest, but they protected her. They gave her 100% control over whether or not she wanted these people in her life, and she choose not to have them around. Her parents stood behind her decision completely. You are one step ahead of my friends parents by already being that support network she needs. Now it's time to show her that it's about who loves her, not what role someone plays in your life. If you father doesn't accept you, but you mother and her family/friends do- they are your daughters family and community now. Show her she has no obligation to keep in contact with anyone who will hurt her.

From the sound of it, you are an excellent mom. LGBT teens need parents like you. Teach her the world will not always love and accept her like you will, but introduce her and surround her with people who do exactly that. Prepare her from reality, but protect her the best you can.

"cxas5h2","I suggested sitting down at a set time each week and go through whatever happened in the past week, nothing else. Good or bad. That way you can talk through things when they are still fresh but starting from a calm mindset. We use a monologue method where the person bringing something up gets to explain how they perceived it and then the other doing the same.

When we sit down and both are prepared to do so it's easier to remember that nothing is said to deliberately hurt the other so that no one gets defensive. Be honest but respectful, don't bring up old stuff if unnecessary and remember that the focus point is to understand each other better. We don't necessarily solve problems but gain understanding about why they happened and how to avoid them next time around.

Soon enough we realized that things that constantly annoyed the other were usually misunderstandings. For example, he mentioned after 8 years that he got irritated every time we were leaving to go somewhere when I was running around the last few minutes which usually resulted in us being a bit late. At the same times I was grinding my teeth because I expected him to help which he didn't unless I gave specific instructions. I explained that the running around wasn't me making myself pretty but making sure the doors were locked, trash put by the door to go out, cats were fed etc. 
Both wanted to leave on time but our priorities differed. We agreed that he would put 3 minutes in his routine to help with those things and suddenly we are always on time. A night out now starts with an excited mindset instead of stress. This could just as well have resulted in us doing those things at another time or whatever but the point is that we identified the issue and agreed on a method to try for a while.

This evolved to him bringing things up on his own initiative when it was happening since he ""might as well say it now"" instead of waiting for Sunday. Now we solve problems as we go along and if anything remains we talk about it on Sunday. We rarely have anything ""bad"" saved up these days so we use the time slot to talk about what was good about the week and plan for the next one, talk about work etc, or just spend some quality time together.

I hope that helps, try what works for both of you.

"cw7s1hx","Honest but terse answer - whichever ones I have to hand.

Honest but slightly more verbose answer -
In my opinion, almost any pepper can find a home in chili, excluding perhaps the extremely sweet or mildly bitter types (like bell peppers / capsicum, which contribute exactly nothing).  My personal favorites are:

* Chipotle - they're popular for a reason, adding a mild heat, intense smokiness, and a hint of sweetness (if you're using the canned, packed in adobo sort).
* Jalapeno - have a nice, grassy, vegetal flavor, again adding mild heat.
* Poblano (or ancho, when dried) - effectively no heat with an earthy, peppery flavor.
* Bjut Jolokia - though they've become something of a trend, the flavor of a bhut is perfect for chili - a mild sweetness, some underlying smokiness, and intense heat.
* Chocolate habanero - while I think regular habanero peppers are often poorly suited to chili, due to the bright sweetness being at odds with the flavor profile that I, at least, like in a chili, chocolate habs bring along all the sharp heat of a habanero with a more grounded, smokier sort of sweetness.",1445446309,"honest but terse answer - whichever ones i have to hand.","honest but terse","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but terse","terse",NA,NA,1

I believe most people prefer dealing with those that are fair and honest. Unfortunately many people out there are neither, both male and female. 

Depending on the culture and general mentality that exists in a particular part of your life (be it home, professional, social, etc) these sorts of things (dishonesty/unfairness) can be very contagious as well to the point where people believe they have to be this way to compete with one another for a chance at success.

Then again the opposite can be true in other circles where everyone is fairly honest and straightforward, but I find at least in my life that this is much less common. 

I do agree that females generally come across as less fair and honest, but I think that partly stems from the fact that a lot of women believe they have a disadvantage (whether they'll consciously admit that or not) and so use manipulative tactics to try and gain an edge. Males are often more straightforward, but not always.

My rationale for the chosen products:

---

* **CPU:** Really good CPU, the best consumer rate CPU if you don't need hyperthreading. Bit of overkill for gaming now to be honest but great price/performance ratio so can't go wrong with it. Especially if the desktop is going to be used for other things as well.
* **CPU Cooler:** Since you didn't seem shy about overclocking I gave you a watercooler. This one can achieve quite nice cooling without producing too much noise. If you're not shy about diy you could also look into custom water cooling kits, which allow you to make it look even better and optimize the performance/noise ratio to what you need.
* **Motherboard:** Really great motherboard for the price! I always like buying better motherboards because I consider it the core of a system and while other things evolve and get better with time, the only thing that really changes in motherboards is the socket, but as long as you are happy with this socket this motherboard will continue to serve you well, even if you want to go to more extreme overclocking or to SLI or whatever. It has really good audio ratings which is nice when using it for music streaming
* **Memory:** What can I say, memory is memory. Really the only thing in real world performance that matters is the amount. You wanted 16Gb so that's what this is. Fits with the red theme I picked.
* **Storage:** A slightly bigger SSD so you can install the few programs that you use often on there. And a big drive to allow for a lot of storage
* **Video Card:** Best card around and red and black theme. You could consider downgrading this if all you do is play flight simulator (but since you wanted top end I gave you top end)
* **Case:** A mid tower with plenty of space, nice front headers and easy installation.It has a window and also has the black and red theme. Cases are very much up to personal taste so find something you like.
* **Power Supply:** Powerful and high quality power supply. I like to suggest higher quality power supplies since you can take your PSU to any subsequent build so the lifetime is much longer in general. This one is also powerful enough for SLI (which the motherboard also allows for) so it makes the build more futureproof by giving you the option to just add another graphics card if at any point you're not satisfied anymore with its graphics output (if that is even possible). It's also a fully modular PSU so it won't look like a cable mess through the window.
* **Keyboard:** These things really depend on personal taste. Go to a store and find out what he likes.
* **Upgrades:** Don't, this machine is overkill, downgrade if you like your money.

"crjh5m8","In response to a lot of the ""she's just being honest"" comments... 

Many people use honesty as an excuse for not bothering with tact or courtesy. I believe that someone who is honest, but also rude, isn't effectively communicating or helping anyone. At best, people will just ignore you because you're rude and offensive; at worst you'll be branded a judgmental asshole. 

People who are rude and offensive (even under the guise of honesty) are also often unconcerned with the people around them... saying that anyone who cant 'take' their honesty should grow a thicker skin. But why would or should anyone listen to someone who doesn't even care enough about the people around them to use basic social skills? It's hard to believe that someone like that is invested and observant enough in any given situation for their 'honesty' to  have value. 


It's a mark of strong and good character to manage to balance honesty and integrity with tact and manners. It's not only ignorant, but lazy to think that integrity and tact are mutually exclusive. To me, part of having integrity is being honest without being offensive.

Don't use honesty for an excuse to be rude. Often, honesty delivered kindly can still be offensive enough all on its own. Many people find honesty a bitter pill to swallow anyway... why dump rat poison on top of it, and then criticise them for choking on it? 

In this example, it was honest of her to be disinterested... it was rude of her to call him 'short and unattractive'. It's hard to make turning someone down better... but it's really easy to make it worse, and honestly she made it about as bad as anyone could. I'm sure she'd say she was just being honest.

"cr7skoh","Customs here in Sweden doesn't mess around with the European Union directives on stuff like this, if you're caught you're facing criminal proceedings. Immigrants often buy stuff to send to their home countries and aren't really aware of the laws. 

Even if it gets out of Sweden it can get caught in a hub port in the EU and then storage quickly gets very expensive on top of the fines. And paying to have it destroyed. If it's waste mixed with other stuff that's a whole problem in itself. And you don't get the money back you paid for the shipment. Some of these immigrants work menial jobs with low pay and save for years to ship a container to Africa, for example. It can be stuff that can be fixed and sold due to lower wages but customs have no way of verifying that.

I would say stay honest but short on the details. What I have found is no matter how much sense it makes to you or logical sense in general it makes no sense to anyone else. I suppose this is for good reason. We have done the work. We have studied, meditated, and performed rituals to have the expansion of consciousness to understand this. other who haven't done the work just can't wrap their minds around it.

"cr22s9m","I'm going to be honest, but hopefully constructive.

I initially only watched half of it, but decided I should give it a go for some helpful words. 

You've got some good composition in a lot of shots, but the zoom into the woods was redundant because the screen went black really quickly, so you couldn't see what you wanted us to see.

I also didn't understand what was happening - she's walking around and looking at stuff. That's fine for set up but when most of your film is that, it's not fun for the viewer to watch.

Pacing is also an issue - half way through I turned up the speed x2 so I could actually watch the whole thing.

I've been there though and I get the restrictions of one person. I found the exclusion of sound odd, though I presume you simply didn't have anyone to record sound during your shoot.

The grey vision probably would have benefited from being introduced at the start, almost immediately, so you could establish some kind of threat to your main character, something that makes her continue to look behind her, around her, something that makes her feel like she's being watched. As it is, it all simply feels coincidental, and I frankly didn't care about the events, and unfortunately I didn't care about what happened to your main character.

So set-up I think is your big lesson from this, set up and establishing characters and conflict/threat. Pacing in the editing room needs work, and make sure you have good coverage of everything. The concept was fine, but working that concept into a story that draws people in needs work.

But you've passed the first hurdle that most of us hit which is making something. I can understand how crushing criticism can be so I'm trying to be helpful and not a douche. Keep making stuff and learn from your errors.

"cr1w4t4","&gt;i don't disagree with this, but i also think that you're either unaware of or not accepting the reality of this website.

I don't think you're considering that this US vs THEM and confirming biases with bullshit stats is how shit goes down pretty much everywhere these days when concerning social issues, since both sides can meet up online in their bubbles and add more layers of self-delusion.  

&gt;i'm done with that on reddit. when you see stuff like this, which is some real statistics mixed in with some made up statistics being used to reinforce people's intrinsic prejudices, getting gilded and thousands of upvotes, it's hard to look past seemingly innocuous statements about ""truth"" and ""honesty"" as being more than dog whistles.
stormfront has been known to recruit on reddit, and this kind of racist drivel comes up in all different forms.

My take is, stop adding to it.  Even though someone might legitimately be a hateful racist, you should try understanding where they're coming from.  They weren't born hateful racists.  The vast majority of people aren't consciously spreading false stats... they tend to copy/paste without checking sources.  It's the nature of human laziness... 

Don't confuse evil for stupidity.  Also, don't you think it's easy for people to add some BS stats that promote their narrative when the opposition dismisses everything they say on one mistake?  Whether he was on point with his stats or not, it doesn't change the fact that there's an issue within black culture that is most definitely integral to the problems we are having.  

&gt;how is this any different than what you're accusing me of? i pointed out that you said something that sounds pretty similar to other ""racial realism"" bullshit that white power advocates use to flavor their statements, and suddenly i'm a social justice warrior (oh, no, social justice on a subreddit dedicated to a sport predominantly played by people of color!), and all of my actions are painted as such.

You made two unwarranted assumptions with each of my replies.  When discussing something serious, people tend to choose their words carefully.  So, I advise you to take meanings at face value.  And that is exemplary of the people who stop good discussion by forcibly talking past each other in order to avoid the actual argument being put forward.  You attempted to shame me by twisting my words.  Is there anything less conducive to progress?

I could be a good guy who you've alienated, or a bad guy who've you've alienated... either way, this doesn't bode well for your cause, which I presume doesn't involve exterminating racists.  

&gt;the default subs have become a cesspool. i'd prefer if /r/nba not go down that path as well.

Well, for starters, /r/nba isn't a place for this type of discussion, so I don't see any reason why we should go ""down that path"".  Reddit's a cesspool because too many people have chosen to forgo honest but difficult conversation with ideological opponents... and have given in to sniping away from their enclosed bubbles.  

You need to stop assuming there's good and bad people.  These stormfront white supremacists weren't born evil... and I'm sure you weren't born so pissed off either.  If you can't engage the other side with understand, kindness and giving the benefit of the doubt... you're honestly only adding fuel to the fire.  Maybe you need to take a break from social justice issues, because the road to hell is paved on good intentions... and that's the Catch 22 of social issues.  Don't lose sight of people's humanity.  That's how people become racists and that's how social justice advocates become social justice warriors.

The only person who can convincr the addict to change their ways is the addict themselves. Pointing out the issue or trying to shove it in their face in rhetoric usually puts them on the defensive and pushes them further away from the solution.

"cpj4foc","Really good insight and good work.

A very similar thing happened to me in therapy.  I realized inside of it I was completely relaxed and ""succeeding by doing open and honest"" but as soon as it ended it was like a steel gate closed on my mind and I shot to 100% anxiety.  I realized I was so afraid of failing that it was ruining everything.

Once I realized this was the underlying cause, it was easy to work out the ""When I was a child I'd get bullied and made fun of whenever I'd make a mistake or share anything, leading me to think I was worthless when those happened, leading me to not share anything and try to 100% control everything I said"".  Then to ""What I think is the real me, what I think is what I should say, if people want to judge me for it that's fair, but if they think I'm stupid for saying something I want to say, then screw them and I shouldn't even think of them"".

In a lightning shock a ton of this SA I had my whole life was just blown away because when you look at it as an adult it seems ridiculous and those worries disappeared.  Now, it's really hard to uncover those underlying motivations and assumptions, and it took a really skilled psychologist who sat there objectively asking me the right questions and making me explain myself, for me to realize them.",1426709190,"i realized inside of it i was completely relaxed and ""succeeding by doing open and honest"" but as soon as it ended it was like a steel gate closed on my mind and i shot to 100% anxiety.","open and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"open and honest","open",NA,NA,0
"cpdcnct","&gt; I'm going to preface this by saying you're one of very few male users here that I think presents your perspective on AA male experience in a way that is earnest and honest, but not reactionary or hostile, especially towards Asian women. I've also noticed you're supportive of other minorities and feminism, which I appreciate.

Thanks! That means a lot.

&gt;That said, I'm not sure that Asian men are all that publicly outspoken about ""pay equality or fighting rape culture or reproductive rights"" - men in general, really. 

I agree. That was my point. I was trying to find an equivalent scenario so that Asian women could perhaps understand how unsupported Asian men can feel. At the same time, I wanted to understand why some Asian women may not feel particularly compelled to publicly support Asian male issues, even if they privately supported them. For example, I believe in feminist ideals, but most of the time, I don't publicly parade my beliefs because I figure that it's not entirely my fight and that my support is more or less understood. But it's probably not, right? More women would probably appreciate more supportive men speaking out, right?

&gt;I've gotten the impression from some male users here that just because it's easier for Asian women to date outside our race (I'll readily admit that), that we are unequivocally more privileged than Asian men, which is simply not true

Yes, that's a very myopic point of view. There's more to privilege than just sex and dating.

That being said, sex and dating are significant barometers of one's quality of life. Yet many times, people dismiss the racialized difficulties that Asian guys face. Some even admit that there's discrimination, but think it's of very little importance when compared to, say, police brutality or socio-economic inequality. Others think that while racial discrimination in hiring or other areas of life aren't acceptable, it's perfectly okay in dating/marriage.

If you deny people their sexuality, you're denying them their basic humanity. That's why it's totally unacceptable to tell gays that everyone about them is fine except for the part where they want to sleep with members of their own gender. 

&gt;And then I'll read comments claiming the issue of Asian male emasculation isn't getting enough visibility, when threads concerning that very issue (mostly revolving around media representation and dating) are consistently some of the highest upvoted and most discussed topics on this sub. 

Yes, but I think we mainly understand this subreddit to be an echo chamber of sorts. When Asian guys complain about visibility, we're talking about mainstream culture. I think we've made a lot of progress in the last 5 years, but very little before that.

&gt;I feel like there's so much focus on us in terms of our sexual currency that you almost never hear mention of Asian women in media without immediate scrutiny about who she's paired with or how she clearly only exists to please the white man

I think the focus and scrutiny are there because the pairing combos are *just so one-sided*. Say what you will about the IR imbalance in real life, but the majority of Asian women are still with Asian men. But in terms of public figures, whether it's real or fictional Asian women, it's more like 90% in favor of White men and Asian women. Seriously.

Until this egregious imbalance is addressed, we can't just ignore it and pretend as though we're White people for whom race and gender and interracial relationships aren't as big a deal.

&gt;concerns regarding Asian male empowerment that comes at the expense of women or come off as attempts to assimilate with hyper-masculine white men (like all the ""getting the girl"" talk seriously gives me white bro vibes)

It's a tricky balance because we're asking Asian guys to give up certain male privileges that they never felt that they had in the first place. I hope you can see why some Asian guys would get very upset when, after a lifetime of being emasculated, they seem to finally have reached a tipping point where they can hope to just be level with other guys, only to be told by some Asian women that they're being a bunch of entitled pigs for just wanting to be ""normal."" 

It's as though the rules are being changed in the middle of the game. I agree that a lot of the rules are messed up to begin with and need to be changed. But I think Asian women should understand the context of the situation Asian men have been in, and not conflate Asian men's experiences with those of White men.

Honestly, some people may judge a little when they notice, but only a few people in about 5 years have actually commented on it to me, and it almost always came from concern and caring. There were one or two people who were totally tactless, but that was back in high school. Strangers have never said anything to me, and frankly its not my problem if it makes them uncomfortable. For people I know casually like coworkers, if they ask I keep it simple with either an excuse that could possibly be true: ""I used to have a really mean cat"" or an honest but simple answer: ""I am/was going through some tough things"".

Ive found the majority of people get the hint and don't press any further. 

In the long run though, when you have ignored the initial insecurity long enough to not notice anymore, most other people probably won't give it more than a few moments thought either.

You say you want to be together and you're attracted to one another.  That's a good start.

But you both have ZERO sexual experience.  You don't know what you like yet, and you don't know how to figure it out.  When you tell him what you need, he gets hurt or has an opposing view.  This is not at all a good start, but the good news is it can probably be repaired if you *start fixing it now*.

You can teach him even with physical cues how you like to be kissed.  If he gets too sloppy and overzealous, back off, smile playfully, and then kiss him in the way you enjoy.  Keep doing that until he gets it.  If he doesn't get it, be honest but kind with him.  If he really wants to please you, which he damn well should, his ego might take a little bit of a hit, but he should be willing to change or at least find something you both enjoy more.

And you aren't asking him to rape you.  You're asking him to be assertive.

My BF had a similar issue.  He's a gentleman.  He isn't a prude in bed at all, but anything other than vanilla isn't something he's ever done.  Sex is making love to him.  And that's all *great*.  Seriously, it's awesome, to have a guy that really, truly, honestly won't enjoy what we're doing as much if *I* am not enjoying it too.  Who respects no, or not right now, or I don't want to do this.  

But, like you, sometimes I want to be told he's been thinking about me all day and pushed against a wall.  Problem is, he didn't see that as something a respectful man would do.  I was like ""But I'm ASKING you to do it.  I'm telling you I WANT you to.  And if your timing is bad, I absolutely will tell you I appreciate the thought, but not right now"".  Although, honestly, unless I were really, really, extremely sick or had just suffered a tragedy or something, there's no way I'd say no to that.  And hey, maybe it would get my mind off whatever upset me for a while.

It's taking time, but he's starting to get it.  He's seen that I respond much better and get much more turned on when he's assertive.  He had no issue initiating before, but there's something about ""I can't keep my hands off you and have to have you NOW"" that does something extra.

But it sounds like he's already shut down and has unilaterally made the ""rules"" about your *mutual* sex life.

I can definitely understand where that's frustrating, and all this is new to both of you so there's going to be some discomfort and some really, really awkward moments.  But nothing is going to get better if you stay in your comfort zone because it's already not working.

It's not pedantic. There is a difference between implied consent and an honest but mistaken belief in consent.

Implied consent has never been a defence in Canadian criminal law. It doesn't matter whether you think it's correct or pedantic or not.

&gt; What I'm trying to tell you is that the layman's definition of implied consent is quite obviously a thing that our legal system understands and accepts

This just is not right. There is a difference between the two that is recognized by the law. In Ewanchuk, the Supreme Court **overturned the acquittal** and entered a conviction because the trial judge erred in using an implied consent doctrine. If you go into court and bring up the words 'implied consent' you're going to be ripped apart by a judge. 

Here's the difference: implied consent suggests that consent was actually present, or by the person's actions it at least seemed to be present. Whether you think that's what it means, that's what it's understood to mean. In cases of implied consent you would look to whether the ""complainant’s conduct was such that it could be objectively construed as constituting consent to sexual touching of the type performed by the accused""

Here's a quote from the Chief Justice talking about what the defence of implied consent would mean:

&gt; The specious defence of implied consent (consent implied by law), as applied in this case, rests on the assumption that unless a woman protests or resists, she should be “deemed” to consent

The mistaken belief of consent moves changes the defence. Implied consent looks at the actions of the person, mistaken belief looks at the mind of the perpetrator.

Again, consent isn't something implicit or explicit. It's either present or not. I get that you understand that, but you're still throwing around the term 'implied'.

This conclusion was an error.  See D. Stuart, Annotation on R. v. Ewanchuk (1998), 13 C.R. (5th) 330, where the author points out that consent is a matter of the state of mind of the complainant while belief in consent is, subject to s. 273.2 of the Code, a matter of the state of mind of the accused and may raise the defence of **honest but mistaken belief in consent**

&gt; The doctrine of implied consent has been recognized in our common law jurisprudence in a variety of contexts but sexual assault is not one of them.  **There is no defence of implied consent to sexual assault in Canadian law** [para 31].

Consent in Canada is seen as something internal - it is completely in the mind of the person. Either the party consents to the action or they don't. 

You say:

&gt; Implied consent means that the accused honestly believed that the accuser had given consent, and thus the accused did not have mens rea, and therefore cannot be convicted of sexual assault.

This is patently incorrect. What you're referring to is an honest but mistaken belief in consent.

Your last part

&gt; Cases involving a true misunderstanding between parties to a sexual encounter infrequently arise but are of profound importance to the community’s sense of safety and justice. The law must afford women and men alike the peace of mind of knowing that their bodily integrity and autonomy in deciding when and whether to participate in sexual activity will be respected. At the same time, it must protect those who have not been proven guilty from the social stigma attached to sexual offenders.

Here's how I would defend myself. The courts differentiate between the defence of implied consent and an honest but mistaken belief in consent. In the SCC case we discussed below, the Supreme court overturns an acquittal after the trial judge wrongfully considered 'implied consent' in making his decision. 

Perhaps from a common sense understanding the two mean the same, and that's likely the case, but I don't necessarily see it like that. Implied consent to me states that a person, through their actions, consented (or at least appeared to) to sexual activity. So you're looking primarily at the actions (or inaction) of the plaintiff - were they submissive, did they kiss back, etc. An honest mistake of consent, to me, means that the defendant, having considered all the circumstances (ie more than just the plaintiffs actions: like, did the defendant pressure the plaintiff, did the plaintiff say no previously, etc) thought that the plaintiff consented when really they didn't.

"cl418qf","Hey, I know there are all of these people saying that Naismith sucks for whatever reason, but I stayed there my freshman year and I had a great time.

- Food there is superb with an in-dorm dining hall, they have a pool, a movie area, a computer lab, a laundry room, and a bunch of other fantastic necessities and luxuries. I think they also recently added a workout area with various fitness machines, but the Rec is literally 1 minute away, so that's not much of a feature, especially since they took out the pool tables to do it.

- You'd have 1 roommate, and you'd be connected across the bathroom with another group of 2 people, or if you wanted to shell out some extra money you can have a room to yourself. When I stayed there, the top 2 floors were also quiet floors for the more private students, but that's  more of a decision for you. I'm pretty shy myself, but I'm glad I didn't go for the quiet floors, because I got to break out of my shell a little bit and meet a bunch of interesting people.

- They also have rather relaxed rules with regards to drinking and smoking, though if an RA or building administrator actually *SEES* any of those things they have to lay down the law, so lock your door/open your window, or even better, go outside to smoke. Also, don't walk around with bottles of booze outside a locked room, and keep it out of sight when the door is open. Oh, and don't be too loud/inconsiderate/stinky/whatever, because RAs who receive a lot of complaints start to crack down.

I'm also from Chicago, and I assimilated pretty well. I'm not very rich, nor have I ever been called snobby, and I wouldn't assign that title to any greater portion of the population of the Nai than I would the rest of the world. My dad *also* stayed in Naismith when he went to KU. When I stayed, there were a lot of Jewish people (which I am not), but getting along with them was a non-issue. I don't see why it would be, to be honest, but other people seem to like posting about it as if it's some sort of negative aspect of Nai.

- You're also incredibly close to both the Rec and the music building (whose name escapes me) which you stated is your major. Additionally, you're not as far from campus as people seem to be indicating. There are plenty of bus routes to take you directly there, and if you'd rather walk it only takes about 10 minutes to get on top of the hill. I honestly found that it took me less time to get to class than most of my friends in the Daisy Hill dorms. It's also not an uphill walk back from Murphy, so that's a plus.

______________________________

I've been in pretty much every other dorm, so I'll list my impressions below, though they're entirely based on my own opinion, so yours may differ:

- McCollum - Really, really bad. Definitely glad that it was removed, you could see the age in it. No private bathrooms, every room looked like its original purpose was to store various industrial supplies, or be filled with water heaters. Pretty sure I remember there being an asston of piping on the ceiling, and I was informed that the AC fluctuated from nonfunctional to inadequate. I'm actually pretty sure that they're closing McCollum, so that's good. Might not even be an option for you.

- Oliver - In the same location as Naismith, but it's just not as nice. Upsides are that it's part of university housing and that it's probably cheaper, downsides are it's in need of renovation pretty badly, no private bathrooms, food isn't very good, etc. Essentially, Nai is better except for those two aforementioned points.

- Hashinger - You might actually like this one, heard that it for some reason attracts a pretty decent crowd of people. Not sure how it consistently does so, but I've seen a lot of Engineers and Fine Arts students living here rather consistently. I thought the dorm itself was *okay*, definitely not nice, just not bad either, especially next to McCollum and Oliver. No private bathrooms, student housing, etc. etc. You'd also be eating at Mrs. E's, which is where the other Daisy Hill students dine. I've admittedly only been three times, but all three it wasn't very good, maybe because I couldn't use my Naismith (not affiliated with university dining) meal plan and had to pay like $8 for some pretty shitty breakfast.

- Ellsworth - Also has a lot of Engineers. Engineers are good people, usually super loyal and some seriously smart motherfuckers, so if the crowd here is anything like it usually is it'll be packed with em. I've heard they have private bathrooms, but I've never seen one, so maybe it's only on certain floors? Also on Daisy Hill, so you'd be dining at Mrs. E's. Overall look and feel is pretty much the same as all of the other Daisy Hill dorms, so nothing particularly special.

- Corbin - Are you a girl? Do you not want to live CoEd? If yes to both of those, pick Corbin. As a member of the less-fair sex, I've only been inside once, and it was actually rather pleasant. Heard good things about it overall, but I'll be honest when I say that college isn't a place where you should be satisfied with gender-separated dorms, it just cuts back on the fun. Besides, if you're in Uni, you're an adult now and you're REALLY close to the real world, meaning you should get used to associating with all different types of people (because you're going to be doing it a lot from now on), and not sequestering yourself in an environment where you spend almost all of your leisure time with only one gender.

- Templin - Honors dorm. Private bathrooms are a yes. Supposed to be filled with the studious kiddies, but in my experience they got rowdy just like everybody else. Overall look is pretty nice, since it's more recently renovated. On Daisy Hill, so dining at Mrs. E's. Supposed to be pretty expensive, but I'm not sure on the pricing anymore. If you're going to pick University housing and not Nai, I'd go with this one, Lewis, a Schol Hall, or maybe those new dorms (which I'll get to in a second)

- Lewis - Looks pretty much like Templin, if I recall. Non-honors. Private Bathrooms = confirmed. Situated right on top of Mrs. E's, so it's the shortest walk on Daisy Hill if you want to get so-so food. Overall nice, but I've only ever been in an actual room once and I was pretty wasted, so a virtual tour might be recommended over my word.

- New Dorms - Not gonna lie... these look REALLY nice. These are replacing McCollum, which is a VERY welcome change. I don't know much of anything about them, but since the last dorm built by the university was completed in I think the EARLY 1970's (maybe?), this is going to be VERY different from what currently exists. They're situated on Daisy Hill, and are supposed to have private bathrooms. I also saw a concept picture a while back, and they look pretty nice, lots of glass in the public areas juxtaposing the brick prisons that are regular dorms, but who knows how close to reality that'll come. If these are open by the time you're enrolled, I would DEFINITELY check them out, and though I doubt they'll have as many sweet extras as Naismith, they'll probably still be miles better than almost all the other University housing.

- Schol(arship) Halls - I don't really know a whole lot about Schol Halls, to be honest, but I'll summarize what I do know. Essentially the students are almost all honors or scholarship students, and they're mostly situated just a bit down the hill from the Union. The students either get a budget or ingredients for food, and they take turns cooking for themselves and several other people (who I'm not sure if they SHARE rooms with or what). Schol halls have pretty nice group areas and lobbies (I think I remember seeing a grand piano in one) and they usually have an attached basketball court. I think. The main feature of a Schol Hall, in my opinion, is the fact that it's a lot *smaller* than a dorm, meaning you're only in the same hall as a couple dozen other people. This has its obvious merits and demerits, but if you really think about it isn't that much different from how people on the same floor of a dorm tend to associate mostly with one another.

- Jayhawker Towers - I know next to nothing about Jayhawker Towers. I have never been inside, I have never seen pictures. I have, however, met people who lived there, so here's what I DO know: The Towers currently houses the KU basketball team (though they're getting a SWANK new pleasure palace) along with a large amount of other athletes, but it seems to function like a regular dorm, since I've met several non-athletes who lived there. Once I hooked up with this girl who supposedly lived there, and she was *ridiculously* *obscenely* hot. Why is this relevant? Because I have since developed the unfounded belief that a lot of hot girls choose to live in Jayhawker Towers so that they can date/bang KU athletes. So... if you think you might have a chance with that type of girl, that might be a reason to live there I guess.

That's pretty much it.

But yeah,

__________________________________

TL;DR: I'd recommend Naismith at the moment, it honestly is currently the best dorm as far as Location/Luxuries/Look goes, but the new dorms might just blow everything else out of the water. Templin and Lewis are also good, Hashinger and Ellsworth are okay but are supposed to have good crowds. Jayhawker is good if you think you can pull girls from Footballers, Corbin is good if you're a girl who doesn't want to live with guys.

"ckz3d56","I've been in pretty much your exact position.  I received adoption records from the government when they were unsealed, and via the names on those records I attempted to track down my biological parents.  I ended up making contact with my birthfather (since his name hadn't changed since the adoption) via Facebook.  Through him, I made contact with my birthmother and biosisters.  Here are the things I tried to keep in mind during the process... I don't know if these helped, but my reunion has gone very well so they couldn't have hurt. :-)

Make your intentions as clear as you can up-front.  I think that helps avoid being scared about ""why is this person contacting me now?"".  I told both birthmother and birthfather that I wasn't looking for parents, but rather that I had always wondered about them, thought they would wonder about me, and I thought they'd want to know I did alright and their choice to give me up worked out; after that, I told them I didn't know what kind of relationship we could have (not exactly clear, but honest), but we'd have to figure it out.

Be patient.  Oh, this is so hard.  But it took about a week for my birthmother to contact me back after she knew about me, and that week was brutal.  I had learned from my birthfather about my biosisters who lived with my birthmother, so I spent that week wondering things like, ""If she doesn't contact me, how long do I wait?  When do I go to my biosisters directly and introduce myself?  Ever?  Now?  Later?""  Every day during the beginning of this process will feel like a month, so, be patient.

Have a friend to talk to.  I wanted to talk about this experience constantly with everyone.  It was the only thing on my mind for months.

Oh, yeah, don't forget the rest of your life.  This event felt like the center of my life, and I put a lot of time and energy into it and neglected other things.  I think that's actually alright... it was a life changing event, after all, so it's hard to prioritize the 9-to-5 job over it.  But don't forget your friends and family, at least. :-)

And... one more piece of advice.  Be prepared for emotions.  Unexpected emotions.  Surprising emotions.  Powerful emotions.  Confusing emotions.  When you literally don't know what you're feeling or why, try to take a step back, gain some space by yourself, and analyse.

I found that reuniting with my biological relatives was generally a great time, but, it was also a time of deep mourning.  I finally learned about the life that I lost.  The sisters I could have had, the parents I could have had.  Even though I love the life I ended up with, I had to mourn the life I lost.  It changed my perspective on a lot of issues.  It changed how I feel about adoption.  A year later, and I sometimes don't know where I fit in to either family.

I wish you the best of luck, and a receptive greeting from your biorelatives.

"cktw059","You should look into this [list of emotional manipulation techniques](http://www.bandbacktogether.com/psychological-manipulation-resources/). They are sadly very common, and after a lot of work I've become aware that I used to use some of those before (learned from my mother), and have stopped completely. 

I find that in a situation like the one you described, you could simply say, very calmly ""That doesn't make logical sense. I am upset that you used the word to describe me at all, and the fact that you've lied to me. The fact that you told me is something one should take for granted in an honest and loving relationship.""

Maybe because it hurts the ego too much, or because they've been raised to never admit faults.

"cj55m40","You will likely get a wide variety of suggestions from different people, but the correct answer will come down to your personal taste preferences - and therein lies the journey of developing your palate.  Take someone with you if you can; it's always a better ride if you have a partner.

My advice is finding a good wine purveyor; someone who knows his inventory, and maybe even offers regular tastings from different wine regions.  Visit their shop frequently so they get to know you and your preferences.

As you're drinking, make some tasting notes to yourself or with your partner. Be sure to read the bottle/winemaker's notes if there are any.  Note how the first sips taste compared to the last few sips from the end of the bottle.  Did the wine ""open up"" and become more full-flavored as time went on, or did it fall apart and become less enjoyable?  These are just some things that might be worth noting as you enjoy the bottle. *Note - the key words are enjoy the bottle; don't over-think any of this.  Enjoy your wine!*

When you return to your wine store, give them honest but polite feedback on the wines you purchased.  For example, I recently bought two different dry rosés from my wine store. We opened them both the same evening, and I thought one was much better than the other.  When I went back to my wine guy later that week, instead of saying the second wine wasn't nearly as good as the first, I told him which one I enjoyed the most, and then I told him what I liked about it.

That last part is the key component in helping both you and your purveyor determine where your tastes lie.  Soon he/she will be able to give you recommendations that will be spot on with both your palate and what foods you will be serving.

Expect your palate to change over time.  For example, my wife used to enjoy sweet Riesling and I used to enjoy big, fruit-forward Cabernet almost exclusively.  I now enjoy more wines from France and Spain, and my wife will not touch sweet wines.  These changes are due in large part to the relationship we've developed over the years with the staff at our local wine store, and exploring varietals we never would've considered otherwise.",1406087256,"*  when you return to your wine store, give them honest but polite feedback on the wines you purchased.","honest but polite","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but polite","polite",NA,NA,1

"cigje6q","I give the devs a lot of credit for being transparent and honest; but there's got to be a point where people start to realize that they've been saying ""we're sorry, this is not how we expected this to go"" far too much.  From name reservation, to server launch, to the numerous bugs (many of which have been around for months even back into beta), now to their inability to keep up with their customer support queue.

It's surprising that an organization can have such solid core competency and yet show a consistent and stunning lack of ability to follow through on delivery.  You don't generally see that sort of disconnect.  It's frustrating because *they've got a great game* underneath it all, and I'm terribly afraid that it's going to get lost underneath their mounting failures.

Take this specific issue for example.  A player that's invested a lot of time into their character, built up a lot of gold, gathered a lot of materials, then has their account stolen and loses it all.  *After waiting a week* they're being told they're not going to get anything back and a set of restoration gear as a consolation.  That player's not likely to continue playing, regardless of how much the account compromise was the player's own fault.  The last thing a promising game needs is players leaving, for *any* reason.   And it raises the question, *what the hell are you smoking if you try launching an MMO in 2014 without having character backup restoration tools?*

Carbine has a duty here to themselves to protect their players from themselves as much as they can, and they've dropped the ball on it; seemingly because they have a fundamental lack of understanding about security.  Their two-factor authentication system is badly designed and as a result outright hostile toward players (while gaining no additional security over a more friendly system!) to the point where I know many people that have forgone using it rather than have to deal with it every time they log in.  Hell, I'd have stopped using it myself if I didn't know better.  They also apparently don't fixate accounts to network regions to prevent farms overseas from logging into accounts, stripping, and botting them in bulk.

Truth be told, and this is coming from someone who's worked professionally securing software for as long as it's been a discipline, the insurmountable ticket queue of compromised accounts is a problem that's just as much Carbine's own fault as it is the players'.  Players, in mass, will always have a base level of incompetence when it comes to securing their own credentials.  That's a known quantity.  You're never going to get players to not use passwords they haven't used elsewhere.  You're never going to be able to make all your players use 2FA.  It's Carbine's responsibility to mitigate that inherent exposure, and they're failing.

"cibmqqv","I love the Tyrion is Aerys II's bastard son theory. To really complicate matters, I don't think his actual parentage will really matter. What is important is that the possibility exists that Aerys is his father. One of Tyrion's main characteristics is his struggle for an identity. This is mirrored in Arya. In ADWD, when Tyrion is under a false name, you lose a bit of who he was through the first 3 books. Only once he reclaims his name, Tyrion Lannister, near the end, does he start showing a bit of the moxy he showed us prior to his killing Tywin. 

In my conclusion, Tyrion's identity will eventually be set by his actions, not his family. That's his character arc. He becomes his own self through realizing that he is **Tyrion**, not Tyrion, son of Tywin.

The biggest criticism of the Tyrion-Targ theory is that it would ruin the dynamic and the relationship between Tyrion and his siblings and his father. I think the criticism is absurd. Nothing will change the years of abuse and derision he received from his family. Nothing will change the years of teaching and experience he took from the Lannister family. His biological parentage is basically irrelevant to everything but his future possible relationship (platonic) with Daenerys.

This all being said, Tyrion possible bastard status by Aerys II is important because it affected how Tywin treated him, which is one of the main driving forces behind who Tyrion became as a human being. Tywin's cruelty shaped Tyrion into the pragmatic, honest, but moderately cruel man he is by the end of ADWD.

The evidence for Tyrion being Aerys II's bastard is as follows. No one piece by itself holds much weight. But together...:

1. Tywin directly states to Tyrion ""You are not my son"" as his final words. Denouncement or truth?
2. Tywin's rage at being told by his sister that Tyrion is most like him. Why the rage at that?
3. Tywin quitting as hand after Jaime enters the KG. Why do that if he had another heir who he was sure was his own son? There is little overt enmity towards Tyrion prior to this (Tyrion was about 8-9 when Jaime joined the KG)
4. Tywin was said to rule the realm, but Joanna ""ruled him"". What does that mean? Did she cuckold him?
5. Barristan Selmy informs Daenerys that her father had loved or been infatuated with a cousin of Tywin Lannister, who is revealed to be Joanna.
6. Aerys II made comments about being sad that ""First Night"" was no more.
7. Aerys II took ""liberties"" during the bedding ceremony. I don't think this implies sex, but increases the likelihood that it happened eventually.
8. Joanna was in Casterly Rock at the time of her death. Tywin was in King's Landing. Is there any significance here?
9. After the Defiance of Duskendale, Tywin's relationship with Aerys never recovered. Had Tywin intentionally let Aerys languish in prison?
10. Tyrion's physical description is odd. His eyes are mismatched and his hair is described as lighter than Jaime and Cersei's. 
11. Tywin's ""You were my colors because I cannot prove you are not mine"" speech. Was this actually much more honest than we realized?
12. Tyrion has repeatedly mentioned having dragon dreams and being obsessed with dragons. This is often a Targaryen trait.
13. Tywin's overall hatred of Tyrion seems irrational. Why the hate? It seems... extreme, particularly for someone who seems so coldly rational about things such as the Red Wedding.
14. If Tywin had been cuckolded by his wife and Aerys, could he ever let it be known to the public? Of course not. He'd be a laughing stock of the realm. Further, he may not know for sure if Tyrion is even his own child. So he risks Tyrion's life repeatedly and uses him when he wants, but never gives him what he deserves (heir to Casterly Rock, respect, etc.).
15. Tywin's sex with Shae. WTF? Why would he do this? He's either a complete hypocrite about whores, or he was trying to fuck Tyrion over in a bizarre fashion, much like Aerys did to him?
16. Tyrion's first introduction to the reader has him given ""A Shadow as tall as a King"" (I'm paraphrasing) and directly say ""All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes""
17. *from ADWD, Tyrion, VIII*: Moqorro (describing what he sees in the flames): Dragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark. **And you.** A small man with a big shadow, snarling in the midst of it all... 
18. Tyrion's curious pick up of a bloodstained dragon piece from the cyvasse board in TWOW, Tyrion II. Further, Tyrion's conversation with Young Griff in ADWD is interesting, given his relationship with the hidden Aegon and their discussion of dragons and his Targaryen status.

Why is Tyrion snarling among dragons? I am suggeting that Tyrion is one of them and that the other dragons are Aemon (old) and Dany (young), Jon (true) and Aegon (false), Quaithe (bright) and Bloodraven (dark).

"chxjydr","I don't know man.. I understand that you are looking for ways to better your relationship, but you really have to ask yourself if MDMA is the answer. First of, MDMA is a tool, not a purpose in and by itself, it is after all called MDMA-assisted therapy for a reason. It can lower barriers, establish trust and allow for things to be said and accepted that otherwise would not be said and accepted so easily. But it's only one part of the equation. Both partners need to be in the right state of mind, and honestly preferably in a controlled environment with a qualified therapist around. Judging from your post and the description of your partner, you may simply not be able to fulfill this second part, especially if you look towards such a session for answers or a connection. I mean, it may give it to you, but not if you load the scenario with pressure. If at all, it should come naturally, no expectations and the enjoyment of eachother. But since you have already spoken to her about it, you have already framed any future use.

Also, anything you can achieve on MDMA you can achieve without it. It's harder, it takes more work, it takes longer, but it's still possible. And a relationship shouldn't depend on MDMA to flourish either. You probably already have everything you ever will need to make your relationship a success, or even to come to the conclusion that this isn't it.

And lastly, even if your partner tries MDMA it seems wrong to me to use it as a relationship tool on the first go. You are much more experienced with it and you know the MDMA state, you can seperate what is the MDMA and what are your real and deep feelings. Your partner won't have that advantage and she may think and say things she may not think or want to say later, which doesn't seem fair to her. Something like this should be done from an equal position, which won't be the case.

On the whole, you might want to reconsider your strategy. I'm all for educating your partner, but you should do it because psychedelics are important to you, and they are a part of you and it would be nice if she could accept that part of you, and even love it.

"chk8yta","A boyfriend 10 years ago, after making sure I'd use protection previously and vice versa, proceeded to give me HPV1 genitally and then genital warts. The warts then spread to my cervix and I had a pap test come bck with abnormal stage 2 cells so had to go to the hospital to get them removed. While the HPV over the years hasn't been too bad, the knowledge that I have an incurable virus that I could give to someone else has been. After I was diagnosed I always practiced full disclosure and always used protection.

I have to say the hardest part of all of this is the disclosure part. Every time it terrifies me - but I do it. As for going monogamous for a while it depends on why you feel you need to. If it's to re-establish trust (even for your own piece of mind) then sure - do it. But if it's just because you're not wanting to be out still doing what you were doing that got you diagnosed, then I'm not sure whether that's going to serve any purpose. You said that you were as careful as possible and any sane person has to recognise that in being poly or non-mono there is always a risk - a small risk if you're careful and honest - but a risk none the less. I also think the faster you can get out and start practising your disclosure talk the better.

As for disclosure - there have been times when I haven't disclosed and while at the time it's certainly been less uncomfortable for me, the stress afterwards about 'what if I've given it to them and I didn't give them the opportunity to say no' is far far worse. Maybe some people  don't worry about that stuff, but I certainly do.

She just relaxed about the whole thing and realized that my disbelief in the religions she was raised in did not make me a bad person, and MIGHT BE RIGHT.

The key element was being honest, but also showing that I was willing and able to examine their religion and it's shared values respectfully.  If you keep people from fearing and hating you, they will usually grow to like and trust you.

"cfvjeuh","Mormonism approaches the idea of ""doctrine"" differently from most. Here's an article which talks about it well: http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/approaching-mormon-doctrine

It brings up a few really key points, the most salient of which, I believe, are these:

1. There exists a hierarchy of truth. This means that some things can be called ""doctrine"" but be unimportant.
2. Things said by general authorities aren't automatically considered ""doctrine."" 

Other resources:

https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith?lang=eng wherein Elder Anderson of the twelve said: 

&gt;A few question their faith when they find a statement made by a Church leader decades ago that seems incongruent with our doctrine. There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many. Our doctrine is not difficult to find.

&gt;The leaders of the Church are honest but imperfect men. Remember the words of Moroni: “Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father … ; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.”""

http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=625 Where Elder Maxwell, who addressed the idea of doctrine and hierarchy of truth a few times said: 

&gt;some of us—and I include myself—sometimes casually speak of education for eternity. Brothers and sisters, it is clear from the verses of scripture that some truths may turn out to have a place in a yet-to-be-revealed hierarchy of truth that the world doesn’t understand. The scriptures tantalize us by saying, “All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it” (D&amp;C 93:30). One even wonders if truths, like planets, belong to a particular order (see Abraham 3:9). But we do not now know.

&gt;The highest education, therefore, includes salvational truths, bringing us a knowledge of “things as they really are, and of things as they really will be” (Jacob 4:13). This focus can be achieved without leaving the usual educational chores “undone” (Matthew 23:23). Scholars like the president of Brigham Young University, Rex Lee, have surely demonstrated this.

&gt;Ultimate orthodoxy—and orthodoxy isn’t a popular word nowadays—is expressed in the Christlike life that involves both mind and behavior. Christ’s manner of life is truly “the way, the truth, and the life,” and he has directed us to pursue his example (John 14:6; see also Matthew 5:48; 3 Nephi 12:48; 3 Nephi 27:27)

&gt;Another important implication of what we have been discussing is that all knowledge is not of equal significance. There is no democracy of facts! They are not of equal importance. Something might be factual but unimportant, as Elder Spencer Condie has observed. For instance, today I wear a dark blue suit. That is true, but it is unimportant. The world does not quite understand this. As we brush against truth, we sense that it has a hierarchy of importance. We are dealing with some things of transcending importance. Some truths are salvation ally significant, and others are not. 


Bonus resource: https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/04/the-doctrine-of-christ?lang=eng

This is bullshit.  Arch users (and even the 'elitists' in the g+, IRC, mailing lists) do contribute.  They contribute a ton.  netctl and kdbus I'm looking at you.  There are plenty of others as well.  Arch has kernel hackers and upstream package maintainers.There is nothing wrong with saying, ""I am at a certain level and I am not interested in dealing with basic problems.""

I deal with people who are not up to my competence daily.  No big deal I get paid for that.  But in my off time, I want to talk about new kernel features and linux issues with some real depth.  If I wanted to talk about systemd 209, Apache 2.4, cgroups, or up coming replacements for ip tables with 30,000 fewer lines in the kernel and no documentation, it would be best if I found a community that caters to advanced users, like arch.

Then there are people who swing by and feel entitled to side track the conversation to discus entry level boring problems and I have no sympathy.  I am elite, I'm not elitist, but I'm very good at what I do. I don't want to talk about problems you created for yourself by not doing it the way that was meticulously documented in our wiki.

If you want support go to ubuntu, they have an inclusive community. They have thousands of shitty support articles with support for the most mundane problems.  It's the old eternal September problem, arch want's it's community discussion to be at a certain level, which can't happen if we have to go back repeatedly and discuss things that are already documented or don't work because the dev of your particular version of arch changed some problem, or if you didn't have the knowledge to set up an arch from scratch (really just the ability to read) so you installed a pre-built arch and then want support.

The thing with communities, is that you can choose what you want it to be and who you let in.  Arch says right up front, we want to be a community of advanced users.  I think that's fair and honest.  But you also can't say that arch doesn't contribute because we don't do entry level support for distros that we didn't create (our entry level arch support is pretty good).

* Q1. Tell me about yourself.
* Rather than giving an autobiographical summary, focus on why you would like this position and how you have prepared yourself experientially and academically. Focus on accomplishments and how you have impacted the areas in which you have worked.
* Q2. Why should we hire you?
* Focus on what your particular contribution will be to a project, department, and/or company success: hard work, dedication, experience. Also focus on your unique impact which aligns with our core values.
* Q3. How has your education and your employment prepared you for this position?
* Discuss any relevant educational or on-the-job experience. You should be able to articulate the areas in which you feel will demonstrate specific relationships to the position and long-term success if you joined the organization.
* Q4. Talk about an accomplishment from the past year that you are most proud of? Why?
* Your answer here should be work-related. You can use a personal example – if the accomplishment can be related in some way to the position description. This question is a great opportunity to illustrate your commitment to Technical and Professional Excellence, one of our core values. Focus on how this relates to encouraging employees to do the right thing for the customer, while demonstrating your aptitude for your area of specialty.
* Q5. Talk about one of your failures and what you learned from it.
* Be honest, but don't feel that you have to bare your soul. Rather, describe a situation in which a failure helped you learn something valuable or achieve future success. Be prepared to articulate the situation, actions demonstrated, results, and lessons learned.
* Q6. Which one of your positions did you like the best? The least? Why?
* For the best, use clear examples that you know relate to the position for which you are applying. For the least, focus on position tasks that you know were necessary and performed well, but were routine, unpleasant, or required little involvement. When talking about these situations, remember to be positive and to never criticize your past co-workers, supervisors, or employer.
* Q7. Describe your strongest communication skills.
* ‘Describe’ means to give an example (i.e., written, verbal, and/or presentation). It may also help to describe a positive result that came from demonstrating that communication skill. The example should be related to the position for which you are applying.
* Q8. Give an example of something you did that saved your employer time or money.
* The best examples describe specific situations where your contributions positively impacted the company’s financials or deliverable timeline. You may also have been a member of a team that produced time and money savings. Perhaps you can describe what that team accomplished and your specific role in supporting this achievement. You may also want to focus on how your actions directly impacted Customer Success. Focus should be on how you enhanced the customer understanding and shared vision for the mission.
* Q9. Think about a large task you organized. Describe the steps you followed.
* You can use either a work or school-related project to illustrate this. Whichever you choose, it helps to be as specific as possible when describing your organizational steps. It is best to use the S.T.A.R. technique: Situation, Task, Action, and Results. This will keep you focused on answering the question more appropriately and concisely.
* Q10. Do you consider yourself a leader? Why?
* Give an example from your demonstrated leadership attributes in work groups, volunteer situations, clubs, athletics, or a work situation. Use this opportunity to demonstrate your focus on two of our core values: Importance of the Individual, and Ethics and Integrity. As a leader, explain how you have held all team members accountable for ethical dealings with customers, team members, and colleagues. Also be prepared to explain how you have demonstrated a shared understanding and clarity around rules of conduct and inclusion for ideas and thoughts.
* Q11. Please describe a situation where you used your creativity to solve a problem.
* Discuss how your ability to look at things from a different perspective can lead to an innovative solution. This area supports our core value of Entrepreneurial Freedom and Responsibility. Explain how your accomplishments have inspired and leveraged your creativity, productivity and/or that of your team members in support of your customers’ mission.
* Q12. What are your greatest strengths?
* It is best to tailor your answer to the position. For instance, if one of your strengths is leadership and you are applying for a technical position, show how your motivational skills work in various situations, or how you hope to reach a project manager level in a few years.
* Q13. What is your greatest weakness?
* Describe how you have turned your perceived weakness into a positive. Remember, weaknesses are the flip side of strengths. For example, faulty time management may be the flip side of concentration and dedication. Procrastination may be the result of wanting to consider all the information and make an informed decision.
* Q14. Talk about your customer service experience.
* Describe how and where you gained the skills to effectively engage customers. Go one step further and provide an example of your exemplary customer service to show your dedication and success. This area supports our core value of Customer Success; it encourages employees to do the right thing for the customer by performing efficiently, and providing exceptional services and products. Be prepared to articulate how you have made a positive impact on your customers.
* Q15. Describe a situation where you have gathered and analyzed facts to arrive at a decision.
* Describing a work-related situation is best. If you don’t have a suitable work story, it is perfectly fine to cite an educational experience. Consider the impact of the projects and how the decisions impacted others.
* Q16. How do you prioritize your work to meet deadlines?
* Give an example that demonstrates this skill and the positive outcome that resulted. Demonstrate how you have taken personal responsibility to ensure that all expected goals and outcomes were achieved. At SAIC, we are focused on the customers' mission and take this very seriously.
* Q17. Why did you leave your last position?
* Suitable answers include: opportunity for advancement, finding work to fit your skills, moving, impacted by downsizing, or changing careers. If you were fired, hated your position, or left under less than ideal conditions, remain positive with your answer. Do not speak badly about the position, the company, or your supervisor. Rather, describe what you learned from the experience and how it has improved your performance and outlook. Great people fail often, but they use failure to learn and improve their performance.
* Q18. How would your friends (mentor, teacher and/or supervisor) describe you?
* Be honest and positive. Remember this is not necessarily how you would describe yourself. Provide descriptions from different types of people who know you. Your friends may see your sense of humor and quirks, while your supervisor might see your dedication and adaptability.
* Q19. What motivates your best work?
* Consider the position. You may be motivated by praise, by being challenged, by having a high level of excitement, or by deadlines. Remember to give examples and choose a particular position that matches your motivational needs.
* Q20. How do you keep track of things you need to do?
* Describe your organizational strengths and give examples. If you have a ‘system’ for remembering important things, offer that. Most answers will work, except saying that you ‘just remember everything.’
* Q21. Would you rather write a report or give it verbally? Why?
* State your preference, but indicate your comfort with either approach as the situation warrants. Knowing the position requirements will assist with this question. Many positions require both skills.
* Q22. Give an example of a high-pressure situation you faced this past year and how you resolved it. Your skills in organization and prioritization of tasks, your willingness to request your supervisor's assistance with establishing priorities, or ability to stay calm in pressure situations — all are appropriate to mention if applicable.
* Q23. Why are you interested in working for SAIC?
* Your research will pay off when answering this question. Visit our Web site at www.saic.com to prepare.
* Q24. Why did you choose your major?
* If possible, talk about how you perceived your major would increase your skills and further your career goals. If you selected a major because you liked the subject matter and didn't have a career plan, you can indicate that, but talk about how the skills you learned apply to the position for which you are interviewing. If you changed majors more than once and ended with one you didn't think was right for you, or if you were influenced by someone else's preference, talk about what you learned from that situation and how it will help you make better decisions in the future.
* Q25. If you could choose a school or major again, what would you change?
* Most answers are appropriate, but avoid negativity when speaking about a school, its teachers, town, etc. If you had a bad educational experience, focus on what you learned from the situation.
* Q26. How do you deal with stress?
* Explain the actions you take when presented with a stressful situation. You can also mention activities you engage in that help reduce stress, such as running, reading, working out, music, etc. This shows that you lead a balanced life.

Lots of people see immediate empathy as caring, and giving solutions as ""you're not reading the situation, and you were giving more head space to the problem rather than me and how I feel"" - emotions burn faster than logic, so it's better to address those first.

You could also just ask her when you both are calm. Something like ""Hey, I noticed I do (X) and that you say you want me to act more (Y), and I'm not sure what I can do to be interpreted as (Y). My intent is (to comfort you, help you, whatever). I care about you, and I want you to feel cared for.""

I see what you're saying, and the problem, of course, is that his definition is a bad one, shaped by a lack of serious study. ""Religion as practiced"" seems to refer to nothing more than ""the religion I'm familiar with and that directly impacts the things I care about."" And of course, real education about religious traditions *as they're practiced*--one of things that's part of theological education in many settings--is going to demolish that limited, simplistic understanding, although I honestly doubt he's open to that. At the end of the day, I suspect that the idea of ""understanding religion"" he's working with really just boils down to ""understanding how horrible 'religion' is and how we can defeat it""--that is, not something motivated by any real desire for knowledge, but by purely polemical and political goals.

"ce8mgsk","I don't know enough about the details of the law to know if Lipman's description of the law is accurate and honest. But just from what he is saying here, there is an obvious problem which speaks either to dishonesty or incompetence. Perhaps the most critical sentence in the entire article is this:

&gt;If we analyze the tens of thousands who are currently in yeshiva learning, there are most certainly 3,200 who are not learning day and night, and all the roshei yeshiva have said that anyone not learning day and night should serve in the army.

So, he argues, if, out of the tens of thousands of yeshiva students, the government only wants to remove 3,200 from yeshiva, what's the problem?

I won't go into whether or not he is accurately describing what the roshei yeshiva have said, nor will I challenge his claim that there are ""most certainly"" over three thousand yeshiva students that don't belong there. ThoughI am skeptical about both claims, there is a far more basic problem here.

The ""tens of thousands who are currently in yeshiva learning"" refers to the entire population of yeshiva students, ranging in age from the late teens into their thirties. Yet, the draft will apply only to a much narrower age range, mainly men in their late teens to early twenties.

As Lipman goes on to say, each year a cohort of roughly 7,500 Chareidi men turn 18. Which means that, from the age of 18 to 24 (the age range he mentions) you have roughly 45,000 young men. So 3,200 is no longer such a tiny number. Moreover, as he goes on to say, the numbers are going to rise quickly.

All of this is fairly obvious from his later statement that:

&gt;According to this plan, 35,500 would continue learning day and night while 17,000 would the country for two years...

17,000 (out of 52,000, presumably) is not an insignificant number!

In short, although the article tries to present the proposed draft as being of minor consequence, the facts clearly indicate that this is far from true.

The fact that he ends the article with basically a threat to do even worse if the Chareidim don't cooperate also does not speak well of his underlying attitude.",1387824282,"i don't know enough about the details of the law to know if lipman's description of the law is accurate and honest.","accurate and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"accurate and honest","accurate",NA,NA,0

"ce4do86","I have done well all my life with women. My advice:

Understand that women are human beings like yourself and will respond to a friendly gesture of kindness. At least any worth having.

Show interest in a woman as a person. When on a date or just in a social situation, refrain from talking about yourself. focus on her. Start with just the usual life things like  job, friends, areas of interest. As thing progress ask more probing questions about their feeling on topics like pressures with work, school, family situations, a movie you both have seen, difficult situations in their lives ( what ever direction she seems to be most responsive to). Interject with your own feelings on the subject and be OPEN and HONEST, but don't allow yourself to ramble. Remember, the focus needs to be on her. She is the most important person in the room. 

&gt; To be honest, borderline worthless.

That needs to change. You have got to understand that that you are a human being with compassion and insights unique in your own ways. Everyone has their struggles. You have to learn to respect yourself and not judge yourself by how you perceive others, or you think others perceive you. Regardless of what others may tell you on /r/short, I know tall handsome men, (even in my own family) that struggle with women because they lack a feeling of self worth. I am hard pressed to find a woman that will ever except a man that has not come to terms with his own inner demons ( even if he is only faking it ). In other words, you can feel insecure about your height, but you are screwed if you show it. That is our burden in life as short men I am afraid.

The rest is the usual. Keep well dressed and groomed. The ability to smile and look happy will always attract more people in general around you. I have a habit of thinking about funny situations and lines from movie that causes me to sometimes smile a lot in public. People will see this and often start to like you for that reason only.

What happened with your mom, happened. You were doing what you thought was best at the time, that's just how it is. So if you can realise that you are actually doing really well, then learn to be a positive person. Every day is a good day, I can't say that enough. There are challenges on a some days but its the perception that matters. You are the experience so if you want to be happy, you have to be happy.

"cbxjy6p","I'm not sure how to avoid sounding like a heartless bastard, so please understand as I'll be honest but gentle.

I'm not saying death isn't sad or hurtful, but it isn't an unexpected and foreign concept.  In the end, how you take it is all dependent on how you approach it.

Death in itself cannot be prevented, only delayed and/or made more comfortable.  In the case of your mother, you can (unfortunately) only try to ease the process and support her as much as you can.  Technically, you can argue that you've known she's going to pass on for decades, ever since the concept of life and death was first understood.  This being the case, you should first understand that it's *your choice* to take your mother's passing so difficultly.  There has been plenty of time and advanced notice that the event will come to pass at some point, so the opportunity to prepare for it has existed for quite a while.

Saying ""it's your choice to feel bad"" isn't meant to put you down or make you feel worse.  It's part of a process for transforming and reshaping your reaction to if/when your mother passes.  If it's a choice to allow the grief that affects you negatively, there are always other choices.  Recognize that there are many ways to approach and handle the death of a loved one, with you being granted the right to choose.

TL;DR  sorry, but it's late and I'm tired of writing a nice, lengthy response.  Too much for both of us.  Ultimately, it's your own choice to feel all full of grief.  ""Suck it up,"" ""she's in a better place now,"" ""I have to be strong for my kid(s) now,"" ""It was bound to happen anyway,"" ""And the world keeps on turning without a care,"" ""The end of one life shouldn't ruin the lives of others,"" ""How would I want my kids to react when I end up dying?"" ""With mom gone, I have to be strong and take care of myself, for my kids.""

There may be hundreds of attitudes and approaches that you can take - both productive and terrible - to the passing of your mother, but you get to choose.  Try to focus on what you need to do, what she did for you, what you can carry over and do for your own children now, and how it will also affect your children.  Lead by example and teach them that it's OK to grieve, but life goes on and you have to be strong.  Stay focused on the living and supporting your unborn and 13 month old.  Don't have them find out that your mother's death was such a traumatizing event that you put your unborn at risk... don't instill the fear of death.  Show 'em how it's important to remember the loved one but also to keep moving forward.  Nobody wants to be burdened with the knowledge that their own death will severely affect the lives of others.  Your mother has always wanted only the best for you and will continue to do so, even in death.",1377761694,"i'm not sure how to avoid sounding like a heartless bastard, so please understand as i'll be honest but gentle.","honest but gentle","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but gentle","gentle",NA,NA,1

The ban list robs them of that experience, but at the same time, it leads to un-fun game-states for their opponents. 

I don't play with these people unless they're willing to sideboard. It's unfair for them to expect you to be okay with some part of EDH that you think is bullshit and unfair. You don't owe these people anything. It's frustrating, because, if you're anything like me, you want to play lots of magic most of the time with most people.

What I usually do when I sit down for a game with someone, I'll tell them I play with Necropotence and Grizzlebrand. If they give me a weird face or groan, I'll ask if they want me to sideboard and they usually do. In return, I'll ask if there are any cards that they think I'd object to. People are usually frank and honest, but I've also had people answer ""no"" and open the game with Island-&gt;Sol Ring-&gt;Mana Vault-&gt;Mana Crypt + X + Y + Z.

The bottom line is that you're gonna have to try and work something out with these guys or just not play with them.

"cb37nyz","&gt; Zimmerman expressed contempt for Martin, admitted to following him, ended up in a fight and after sustaining some injuries Zimmerman shot Martin. That is enough to go to trial. You don't need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt just to go to trial.

Let's assume for a moment that everything you just said is 100% entirely true. No jury in the country would be right looking at that and rendering a guilty verdict. 

Look right or wrong in deciding to follow him (and Zimmerman was entirely wrong in following Treyvon ... at this specific time anyway), **it's irrelevant**. It's WHOLLY and entirely irrelevant to the **legal** issues of this case. The murder 2 / manslaughter charge is predicated on an imperfect self defense claim: the state had to prove that Zimmerman used an honest, but unreasonable, use of force in defense of himself. 

Ok, Zimmerman was a racist twat that profiled Treyvon and followed him. Big fucking deal. Racist twats are still entitled to self defense. People who make poor decisitions and end up in life-threatening situations still have the right to defend themselves. If I walk down a dark alley at 2am in a high crime area and 3 people approach me to mug me, the defense doesn't get to rest their defense on my decision to turn in the alley in the first place. 

No, what matters is how the physical altercation starts, how it proceeded, whether Zimmerman had an honest belief that his life was in jeopardy during the fight, and whether that belief was reasonable given the circumstances.

We don't know who initiated the fight. We don't know who the aggressor is. As you said, ""ended up in a fight"" -- but there is no evidence as to how that fight started, who started it, and how the fight was going before Zimmerman's decision to pull out his gun. We have theories, and guesses, but the criminal standard requires **beyond a reasonable doubt**. The state is required to provide a theory of how the fight was going and have evidence to substantiate it. Without that evidence, the state cannot meet their burden. At no point during the trial did the State ever proffer any theory whatsoever. That's not only fatal to the case, but probably worth a bar complaint for malpractice -- it's that stupid.

The jury verdict was a complete non-surprise to me. After watching the trial, and hearing that pitiful excuse of a closing that the prosecutor gave (I'd wager any trial attorney would agree with me that that was one of the worst closings they've ever heard in a high-profile case like this one), there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that the jury couldn't convict Zimmerman. The state completely failed to met it's burden.

Now, I will sit here and say that if that's all the State had, and that was their case, they should never have brought it. It does no good to bring a case prematurely without enough evidence. They should've sat on it for several years (hindsight is 20/20) and hoped for more evidence... maybe Zimmerman gets drunk and admits he killed the kid in a bar some night. I don't know. But the State's case was fucking garbage.

EDIT: And it pisses me off to no extent that the TV Heads keep talking about how Zimmerman profiled Treyvon. The moment that they can convince me that his decision to racially profile Treyvon is in any way relevant to the issue of whether Zimmerman used unreasonable force in self-defense, I'll stop calling Al Sharpton and the lot fucking morons. There are legal issues and moral issues here, when you mix the two together, you end up sounding like an idiot.",1373915339,"the murder 2 / manslaughter charge is predicated on an imperfect self defense claim: the state had to prove that zimmerman used an honest, but unreasonable, use of force in defense of himself.","honest, but unreasonable","honest","but",TRUE,"honest , but unreasonable","unreasonable",NA,NA,1

Leffler quotes him quite differently, in a letter to his wife from the Potsdam conference Truman writes: 

&gt;""I *like* Stalin. He is straightforward. Knows what he wants and will compromise when he can't get it"" (Cambridge History of the Cold War Volume 1, page 70)

As to the pre-cold war conflicts that's from Geoffrey Roberts ""Soviet Union in World Politics"", page 14

&gt;Of course, there were many tensions and contradictions, even crisis, in relations between the USSR and it's western coalition partners during this early postwar period; it is tempting to over-dramatise such conflicts and to read back into them the origins of the cold war. But at the time the diplomatic and political agenda of Soviet-western relations was still primarily a collaborative one, based on the assumption that the conflicts of interest and perspective were those of allies and that , with good will, the unity of the Grand Alliance would be maintained. Even Churchill in his notorious 'iron curtain' speech in Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946 did not challange this assumption. The former Prime Minister denounced Russian and communist tyranny in eastern Europe and complained about the exclusion of western political influence from the region (that was the point about the 'iron curtain'). But Churchill also talked about the possible prolongation of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet treaty of alliance into a 50-year-pact and of the need to reach a 'good understanding' with the USSR.

&gt;For their part, the Soviets constantly and consistently affirmed their commitment to making common cause with the British and Americans in a peactime Grand Alliance. As late as May 1947 - on the very eve of the outbreak of the cold war - Stalin gaven an interview to the US Republican Senator Harold Stassen in which he said: 'Not only can [the Soviet Union and the United States] coexist... they can also co-operate; if they did so during the war, why not now? Lenin said that the cooperation of the two systems was possible, and Lenin is our teacher'

When they first met, Truman wrote in his diary ""I can deal with Stalin... honest but smart as hell."" 

By the end of 1945, good will for Stalin was dissolving. Public opinion in the United States (and within the U.S. government) was dividing, with many Americans deciding Stalin could not be trusted. Anti-Soviet views skyrocketed in the press, and Congress was getting wary. 

Accommodation was wearing Truman thin. In February 1946, his administration made an abrupt shift to confrontation. On February 3, Soviet atomic spies were unearthed in Canada. Six days later, Stalin announced in a major speech that communism and capitalism were incompatible. 

Truman wanted to confront Stalin, but he had a weak military, was avoiding open cooperation with Britain (for fear that Stalin would feel ""ganged up"" on and do something rash), and New Deal liberals were fighting hard to stay friendly with the USSR. The Truman administration seized on Churchill's March 1946 Iron Curtain speech and the 1946 Long Telegram by George Kennan, and it announced in September 1946 that it was going to maintain its military presence in Germany indefinitely.

Wolverine and Skrull are both very good characters. It's pretty fortunate that you enjoy playing these characters.

There's an important question that I must know however to see how the team should be played, which is: Do you like Skrull anchor? Or do you like him secondary. Wolverine should always be point in my opinion since he gets a lot of mileage out of supporting assists whereas his support options as an assist is not very impressive.

If you like Skrull second, here's some suggestions for an anchor character:

- Vergil: All purpose anchor. Rapid slash can be used to extend combos and convert off of throws with Wolverine. Can also help Skrull as well, but not a super powerful neutral game assist. Vergil is also one of the more powerful characters in the game, so you can't go wrong with him. Reference: PR_Rog for Wolverine/Vergil combos.

- Shuma-Gorath: Not a very good character at all to be honest, but Mystic Ray is easily one of Wolverine's best assists, and it can help Skrull a lot too (can call Shuma and do meteor smash to make it safe). The problem is, Shuma-Gorath is no good, but you get bonus points if you want to do something creative. Reference: Haz|Angelic for Wolverine/Shuma mix-up and combos.

- Taskmaster: Capable anchor character, but horizontal arrows are very beneficial assists to both Wolverine and Skrull.

Now... if you like Skrull anchor (and I love Skrull anchor). Then my absolute best recommendation for you would be:

- Frank West: I recommend this character for you. Wolverine can level up Frank to 4, easily via TACs (See Noel Brown), but if Wolverine goes down, you still have Frank West backed up by Skrull to level up Frank. This team is heavily based around TACs however, but the guessing game is still in your favor. I like the concept of a Wolverine/Frank/Skrull team a lot, so try it, not to mention, Shopping Cart is an incredibly fast and powerful assist for Wolverine.

As for your question regarding synergy between Wolverine and Skrull, I don't imagine there being a lot, but I'm pretty sure you can come up with some nice combos with Wolverine using Skrull's Stone Smite assist (example: s.L, s.M, s.H, S, super jump, MMH, drill claw, dive kick, (land), jump, MHS (call Skrull), etc.)

"c7kbv84","Well, as I have been in this situation (with a non-Mormon though) I can totally relate to you.  Exploring your sexuality is fun and healthy if you do it right, but I think it wise to consider a few things first:

1) Make sure you're ALWAYS open with your girlfriend.  If she ends up wanting to confess, you shouldn't jump on her back if you really want a relationship with her.  If this is more casual then whatever, but makes sure you're being respectful and empathetic with her because she's in the same place you are.

2) If your family finds out, particularly your TBM parent(s) they'll want you to repent.  They won't let you bless the sacrament or pass it, and you'll find church is harder and harder to tolerate itself which in turn can lead to some bitterness.  I'd say if they do find out, be open, and honest, but also respectfully defensive.  Stand by what you believe, and tell them you're old enough to make your own decision with regard to the church and sexuality.  It might be emotionally strenuous and very difficult to talk with them, but if they find out it will be a must as long as you plan on staying in that household.  Unless they're not strict, which at that point you just need to make the calls.

3) Remember that as good as it feels, you always need to keep the lines in mind.  I'm sure you're aware of the consequences, as awful a word as that is, of what happens when people go a little too far and end up with something they're not ready for or don't want.  Just a caution, as you might already have considered this, but a reminder as I know plenty of guys that got in over their heads.  It would be bad enough to have your parents find out, it would be ten times worse to explain to them something else.

None of us have experienced your exact life or relationship, so it's hard for us to make a judgement like that. Having said that however.. it does appear that you two met at similar points in your lives, and while you have been going from strength to strength (or at least growing in that direction) he appears to be stalling completely, if not going backwards.

As further to that, it is very evident by what you have written that the longer this has gone on the more angry, frustrated and resentful you have become at him and the relationship. This doesn't necessarily mean you two couldn't work things out if you worked at it, but you would both really need to work at it and communicate a lot and given the rest of the information you've provided about him, that seems pretty unlikely at this point.

So that leads us to the break up, which it seems like you've already realized is a foregone conclusion at this point. The basic tips I'd give you would be:

* Make sure you want to break up.
* Resist the urge to unleash and instead be honest but brief.
* Make your side of it is about how you feel, not everything that is wrong with them.
* Pick a good time.
* Figure out how to do it - face to face is best if you want to do it 'right', but if that means you can't do it for a long time yet or will put the other person in a bad place (relying on you for transport etc) then phone would be the way to go.
* This one seems a bit heartless, but don't give a huge amount of notice when saying you want to talk, particularly if the other person is a huge worrier. Saying that you have something important to talk to them about in a few weeks can send some people crazy.
* Make sure you see it through. This can be a tough one, particularly for those of us that are fixers, as we can be lulled into that mindset and then want to fix them by taking them back.
* Resist the temptation to remain friends. This is something I've seen people do over and over - they break up and agree to remain friends and soon enough things are complicated and messy and people get hurt again. It's possible to be friends afterwards, but there needs to be a decent amount of time for both parties to move on emotionally.

"c7bfcv1","It's so difficult!! I know what you mean. I honestly don't believe that weight is the issue for you because you've already said that even though it bothers you, you still find him attractive (and ""jump him""); and it's complete normal to point it out to him, too. After all, we are visual creatures. 

I think that the best solution is to talk to him, be completely open and honest, but not emotional. I think that some guys (including mine) once they see a little bit of it, they get either defensive or just bothered by it because they don't know how to deal with it or because they may have been manipulate with emotions before, so they just block the conversation out. 

A deadline, maybe just for you, might help. You know, if he didn't show progress by such date, then end it.
There's a song in the musical Avenue Q that says something along the lines of ""there's a fine line between love and a waste of time""
And believe me, this is easier said than done. 

I always find it helpful to write letters (I never send them) and after reading them a couple of times I decide if what I'm feeling or how I'm seeing things is correct or skewed. Maybe writing a letter or in a journal, in detail, about your situation might help you see things clearer.

I feel stuck as well, because I love my boyfriend and I don't want to make a hasty decision or be one of those ""everything has to be done my way, how dare you not validate everything I say or do"" girlfriends. I don't want to feel like a crazy person. The key, I think, is to make a rational, well thought-out decision. In the end, if he's not giving you what you need emotionally and physically, and worst, if he's not validating you and making you feel that it's just you, then maybe he's just not for you. Even if you love him. That's not enough. Don't settle. Again, I know it's a hard decision, because if he makes you happy the rest of the time, it's easy to focus on the happy times and ignore the bad ones, but you have to ask yourself, do the happy times or good qualities outweigh the bad times or bad qualities? 

I believe in second chances, not thirds or fourths.

"c75vp7z","Hey sadbride, Internet hugs for what you are going through. Weddings are rough, no way around it. I got married last year, maybe I can help a little. First of all, breathe. Weddings are one of those things that everyone (incorrectly) feels entitled to have an opinion about.

 Family quickly focuses too much on the word wedding and not enough on the word marriage. The truth is, whether she's made it known to you or not, your mom's had her own plans for your wedding, probably since before you were born. These plans also probably never took into consideration the (probably awesome) person you'd grow-up to be or the fact that when the time came, you'd have your very own and very different opinions about what this wedding would look like. People (very often parents) also tend to tie a false sense of social status to weddings (which is why we have so many obnoxious wedding reality shows). 

There's a really good chance that whatever your mom had planned in her brain, and carried with her through the moment she discovered your plans on FB, were exactly what she considered to be ""the right way"" to have a wedding. And since it seems that your plans are very different from hers, she probably considers your plans to be the wrong ones. Now this next part will be tough to do. You need to see things from her point of view. Not because she's right, not because you're expected to bow to her demands, but because it will help you to understand the incredible insanity that you are experiencing. 

She's doing what most mothers are programmed to do. Just how she'd lick her finger and clean your face or constantly tug on the shirt you're wearing to make it fit ""properly"" or second-guess any decision you've ever made in your life, she's trying to help you ""do the right thing"".

You need to be honest, but tactful, with your mom. If she's paying for your healthcare then she's cannot be unaware of your financial constraints. you really need to lovingly, but not patronizingly, explain to her that whatever your initial plans were, we're what you REALLY wanted. That you've put a lot of thought and care into whatever you had originally intended to do. Don't be surprised if she questions every single thing you say; she probably thinks she's still right and you just don't get it. But more importantly she is, hopefully, in her own painfully misguided way, just trying to help you get the most out of this super-special time in your life. 

Sorry for the long post, but I totally feel your pain. My mom was a raging nut-bag from the moment my husband asked my mom for her blessing. She completely wrecked my proposal, and really didn't show any enthusiasm for my wedding except to point out my mistakes. I also had to deal with a maid of honor that was more perturbed at the thought of having to be a part of my wedding than excited and a sister that honestly gave zero fucks about our special day.

You'll get through it, just remember two things. Spend your money wisely, regardless of what others thinks and the real fun starts after the wedding. It's real work, but the rewards are very awesome.

You said ""preferred"" to be intimate, I didn't say prefer. Prefer implies favor.

The interesting thing to me is how business will handle this. The law clearly states that it is still at a companies discretion as to allow marijuana (OR marihuana or whatever) use. If the law is to truly treat marijuana like alcohol, like it says, then a some sort of new test, like these mouth swabs I have read about, needs to become mandatory, rather than the standard urine or hair test, for obvious reasons. The whole problem is the time it remains detectable in your system, but not depending on if you are intoxicated at the time of the test. 

True story here. I live in a state with medical laws (MI) and my friend received probation for public intoxication (alcohol) and received drug testing. After this, about two months into probation, he got his medical card and told his probation officer, as this will negate a positive test. The officer basically said ""ok well you won't be taking drug tests anymore."" My fried said he would gladly remain on the tests to show he wasn't doing any ""real drugs"" as a joke, seeing that he really doesn't, and the officer said ""What's the point?""

That sounds kinda overdone and Mary Sueish. An assassin trained from birth with the power to use Hammerspace? Can't die, and struggles with his destiny? Immortal? Named ""The Shadow""?

Might be good to identify the core of the character and focus on only that. What is the purpose of him being immortal and able to use a bunch of weapons from hammerspace? What challenges does someone face when they can't die, and can pull anything they want from thin air, and teleport? It seems like any actual danger he might face would be if he's without the ring. It's kind of like Superman: if you want Superman to be challenged, the villain has to have Kryptonite. Likewise, your character can't ever actually be threatened unless they somehow take his magic ring.

"c6pktbd","Honestly, the thing that comforts me most is to acknowledge my feelings. The sooner, the better. You don't necessarily have to admit to being wrong if the outburst really is over something trivial. As an example: a friend is visiting from out of town and you decide to hang out for the evening, then BPD person suggests hanging out and you've said ""Sorry, I made plans with my friend who I haven't seen in a bit."" BPD partner/friend says ""Ok, fine, see you later,"" and breaks down in tears/anger when they finally see you again and accuses you of not being invested in the relationship/friendship and not really loving/liking them and only wanting to be with them as a last resort. Some kind of typical overreacting, insecure hysteria like that.

Honest, but considerate no-fault response is, ""Wow, I had no idea that seeing my friend tonight for the first time in ages would upset you so much. I'm really sorry that you felt so hurt and neglected but I really do love you (substitute ""care about our friendship"" if this is platonic) and I was still thinking about you and telling my friend all about you when we were hanging out.""

You're not saying that it's reasonable to freak out over you hanging out with someone you haven't seen in a while or making any sort of unrealistic promise to never let it happen again, but you *are* acknowledging that regardless of the magnitude of the supposed offense, the *emotions* that your partner/friend is feeling are huge and affecting them in a big way and you don't enjoy them suffering like that. You're also letting them know that they weren't forgotten and out of sight doesn't mean out of mind. Now if you honestly did screw up something legit then by all means, apologize for the action as well because that would be rude not to, but don't feel obligated to apologize for things that are normally considered acceptable behavior.

What it boils down to most of the time is a hugely overblown fear of being rejected and abandoned so reassurance that you're not really rejecting or abandoning them and want to stay close is the easiest way to deflate the emotions. In the rare case of my earlier example of getting upset over being touched on the arm (which wasn't about a fear of rejection and therefore an unusual spark for my BPD), acknowledging the feelings and offering sympathy is still a valid way to go about patching things because it is scary as hell to suddenly be filled with rage and know inside that it's unjustified, but not know how to stop it because your emotions just exploded like crazy without any warning. It's still comforting to know that even though you're suddenly at your lowest and your brain unexpectedly turned you into a psycho raging maniac, your friend still cares about you regardless and wants you to feel better. 

That being said... the emotions are usually pretty short lived. I rarely stay so angry once I've slept on it so if you're not having any luck diffusing the situation it may work better to just wait until the next day to really tackle the problem and try to patch things over. I may still be uneasy inside and unhappy about whatever sparked me off and kind of having a passive aggressive temper tantrum in my brain doing stupid stuff like silent treatments, but it's really hard to maintain the initial intensity of emotions for more than a day and might be easier to have a conversation at that point. Being ignored usually makes me feel worse though and gives me time to think of more and more offenses and signs to tack onto the initial list of upsets so that's why I think a safer bet is to try a quicker intervention rather than defaulting to waiting for a day.

As far as the second part goes... that probably depends on how they view the ex in the first place. I've had exes get in touch through facebook or a text and we get to chatting and share some great stories and it's awesome and we become friends again. I like most of my exes so I like having friendships with them and in that case it doesn't seem like stalking at all. If they start acting like they want a relationship or sex though and I conspicuously bring up my boyfriend and they still keep flirting then I start to become more wary and tend to quit responding to their messages or only give really curt, polite, one-word sorts of answers rather than trying to maintain a dialog with more thoughtful responses. I will admit that my polite rejection hints can be kind of awkward since I have an open relationship, but I usually throw in a remark about feeling uncomfortable sleeping with exes as opposed to strangers to try and make it a little clearer that I'm not looking to sleep with people I know (I'm not honestly totally against that, but I'm a very non-confrontational person outside of my outbursts and it's an easier way to let them down than saying ""Sorry, I don't find you attractive anymore,"" or ""Sorry, you were never good in bed."") If a guy seems a little too enthusiastic about pursuing me at that point then it starts feeling stalkerish and makes me uncomfortable. Ordinarily though I'm not bothered by old boyfriends getting in touch. 

Sorry this is so huge... I'm really not good at writing things in a very quick and concise way because when I do choose to write it's usually on something I care about deeply and I have way too much to say on the matter. I hope it is helpful regardless.

Also sorry it took so long to respond. I shared a rape story once on some other subreddit and had some jerk try to argue with me about how my experience really wasn't rape and wasn't a big deal (it had been a very traumatic experience for me when it happened regardless of what random internet jerkwad thought about it) so I've been wary of reading responses and don't really look at the page that shows my inbox and responses anymore.

"c6fajk5","I don't think it's weird, and I think it'll only impact your relationships negatively if you don't make adjustments and room for your SO's feelings. Basically, use common sense. Some women won't be interested in a relationship at all with someone who has close friends who are exes, and you should expect some women being uncomfortable with it, and who will not stay with you when they learn this.

If she _is_ cool with you being friends with your exes, it's important to discuss boundaries. For instance, my husband is friends with some of his exes. I'm cool with him talking to them, and hanging out with them, but I'm not okay with him taking trips with them, or if he started hanging out with one of them alone excessively, because that would suggest intimacy. I'm also not okay with him or his exes purposefully excluding me (basically, I'm always welcome to hang out with them.)  If he wasn't okay with these boundaries, we probably wouldn't be compatible. So establishing those are important.  Another thing would be not to text or call them constantly, especially when you're with your girlfriend. Basically, common sense and respect. 

Some people are not okay with their partners being friends with their exes, but some people are not okay with their partners dictating who they can and can't hang with, so you might not be compatible with someone who doesn't want you to keep your friendships. 

I don't think you need to lead with this information. If you come right out with it, it'll be obvious that it's something that _you're_ worried about, and will make it seem like it's something _she_ should worry about. I would say you should mention you dated these women when she meets them, which would usually be pretty early on. Something like ""I want you to meet my friend, (name). I've known her for awhile, we used to date a long time ago."" Be clear and honest, but casual. There's no reason to make a big deal out of it, because it isn't one.

"c6f74fo","I get the feeling that you're more than a little biased. Allow me, if you don't mind, to point out the errors that stood out to me the most.

&gt; Besides, being brainy is often a bad thing - relying on natural intelligence is less rewarding (and more lazy!) than perseverance, hard work and commitment - traits you'll find in...Hufflepuff.

[The fuck?](http://gifs.gifbin.com/092011/1316713879_castle_reaction.gif) There are a total of 0 circumstances in which, objectively speaking, being smart is a bad thing - obviously there are ways in which it can be bad (politics, for example, where your opponents will denounce you as elitist and a nerd), but no *objective* ways that a dumb person is better than a smart person, all else being even.

&gt;  **Cunning** This isn't even a virtue IMO. Scheming, lying and manipulating to achieve your ends is nothing to be proud of - and let's not forget that virtually all dark wizards came from under the silver and green flag.

I'll give you that most Dark Wizards in the books come from Slytherin, but this is down to a simple fact: they all are descended from followers of Voldemort. When V was in school, he was admired and pretty much worshipped by all of Slytherin - this would include the parents and grandparents of most of his Death Eaters in the books. Abraxes Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy's father, would've attended Hogwarts around this time, for example. Secondly, cunning is *too* a virtue. You think that people can win a war just by throwing troops at the enemy (which would be the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff strategy)? Fuck that. You need to have strategy and tactics, both of which fall under the label of cunning.

&gt; Ernie Macmillan: When he realised he was wrong about Harry being the heir in CoS, he swallowed his pride, admitted he was wrong and shook Harry's hand. Not many 12 year olds would be so just and true.

Being able to fess up to your mistakes is admirable and honest, but it seems more like chivalry than any of Hufflepuff's traits to me.

Your whole sections on the Founder's possessions is *wrong*.

&gt; Ravenclaw had a diadem that apparently made you cleverer. This shows an insatiable appetite for knowledge and this would frankly worry me - wanting more knowledge is only a short step away from wanting more power...

Again, knowledge and the desire for knowledge is never a bad thing. It can lead to bad things, but only when you have the desire for knowledge and a lack of wisdom - but wisdom also comes under the purview of Ravenclaw. 

&gt; Slytherin had a locket. Vanity ain't no good thing in my book

Like many things, vanity is bad in excess and healthy in moderation. As a matter of fact, he probably did mean it as an heirloom, and had it made after he was already rich and famous as a Founder of Hogwarts.

&gt; his obsession with pure-bloodedness

While the books make out Slytherin as a terrible guy, all that we know of him is filtered through anti-Slytherin prejudice on the part of the good guys and anti-muggleborn prejudice on the part of the bad guys. We don't have access to more unbiased perspectives. So we really don't know what he was like, except that he left Hogwarts near the end of his life after an argument with the other Founders. Besides, remember that muggleborns at his time would all be uneducated and superstitious, which might have formed the basis for his ""hatred"" of them.

&gt; gung-ho attitude of courage and brawn

Wizard's aren't much for brawn, actually. Just like with Slytherin, we don't know much about Gryffindor. You make the assumption that he's a big, fighter-type who sees violence as the answer to any question. But as a skilled wizard, this doesn't fit. We know that he valued chivalry and bravery, sure. But brains over brawn? No support for that in canon.

&gt; She enjoyed a bevvie or two after a day of making friends and being fab.

This is the most unfounded thing I've ever seen. Perhaps Hufflepuff's chalice was meant for serving wine or booze, yes. It might also have been an enchanted goblet of some sort (perhaps it never ran out of water, and was used in Herbology). It could've been meant for serving potions from. It could've been an heirloom of her family that got renamed after her.

"c58gugg","&gt;So anyone that isn't making millions is just lazy? ;-)

That is nothing what I just said. Not everyone has to own their own company (that's the point of capitalism: you have those who own and and take financial risks, while there are workers, who are responsible for their own work, have smaller risk and also have smaller benefits)

&gt;I'm unconvinced of the wonders of capitalism. As I see it, the greatest blight on society today is ""The Gap"" between rich and poor. Capitalism in the American form widens the gap and then tries to distract us from how miserable we are by giving us iPhones.

Yet even the poorest of poorest Americans still have access to food, water and even electricity. The poorest man has more possibilities to communicate, travel and do many other thing that the kings and queens of the mightiest nations just 300 years ago couldn't even dream of. 

Alright, there are many problems in our society and I'm not trying to belittle them. It's just that fact, that being poorER than others is not a reason to take their money and distribute it equaly. Inequality is one of the driving forces for innovation. While capitalism takes the bad nature of men (greed and wanting to be better than others) and turns it into a motivating force, from which everyone will benefit (the baker creates bread not because he wants to help you, but because he is greedy and wants more to himself, yet all (the consumer and himself) benefit from it). Communism on the other hand suffers from the fact, that men are not good and honest, but lazy, greedy and egoistic. And it leads to suffering for everyone.

&gt;Measuring ""success"" as ""wealth"" is also part of the capitalist indoctrination. For me, success would be social justice.

What do you mean social justice? Everybody have exactly the same things (even though some fancy one kind of things and others different)? Or should everyone do the same thing? Or is social justice when everyone gets as much as they deserve? Or should we all just be respected as we are and live the life as we want to? 

Absolute social equality seems silly and even dangerous. The whole idea of equality is fuzzy. We are clearly not all equal, at least not physically, mentally and even our desires differ massively. Should all be equally happy? 

I have no problem with people being equal, as long as anyone isn't held down. Socialism unfortunately keeps people down. Forcing people to do something is the one only thing a State can actually do (that normal people couldn't)

&gt;Seriously, Das Kapital. You can read it on a Kindle for free!

I know you want to be able to say it out loud and keep you relationship with them open and honest, but that might not be the best course of action for you right now.

You're only 19.  You'll have plenty of time to find the right time to discuss it with them.  Give yourself some time to mentally adjust.  There is a level of strength, mentally, that starts to build about your age, in regards to who you are, or who you want to be.  Take whatever time you need.  It's your schedule because you have realized that it truly is your life, your one and only life on this earth.  So follow your instincts and find a time and a way that works for you and your family.

I have a friend that has never told his fundamentalist parents that he is an atheist.  He doesn't live in the same state that they do, so there isn't a whole lot to hide.  He just says that he doesn't go to church when they ask about it.  Even that upsets them greatly, but now they are in their 70's.  The three of them seem to have worked out some code.  They know not to ask too many questions, and he knows to avoid the sticky topics.  He tries to visit them any time other than Xmas and Easter as much as he can.  It's the game they play, and it works for them.

Find your own way.

"c4yi508","&gt;natural criteria which I've **consciously** controlled and shaped

and 

&gt;and the logical ones which I put in place completely consciously.

* Choose your favorite food. 

Now consciously control and shape yourself to hate it. So that when you taste it your body gags at the disgusting taste.

* Choose a food or taste you truly despise (for me it's [Uni](http://www.sushiencyclopedia.com/sushi_menu/sea_urchin_sushi.html)

Now consciously control and shape yourself to love it. So that when you bite into its succulent flesh you cannot help but want to finish everything morsel in sight.

Point is you really have very little overt control over things you like and dislike.

&gt;Neither of those categories have any criteria which are impossible to achieve.

Maybe you're an idealist but the longer you experience reality the more chance reality has to smash you in the face with the realization that what you stated ignores *nuance*. 

Want your partner to be honest? But no one wants them to be so unbelievably honest during that one critical office party where you boss is at that ruins your chance of advancement.

No you want their honesty tempered with social cues as to when and where it is appropriate. So you want them to be social adept and honest, but ignore the honest aspect when the proper social cues are triggered. So not 100% honest. Just honest enough. 

Nuance motherfucker! do you speak it?

Everything is grey. there is no black and white. You want your partner to be brave but not foolhardy. You want your partner to have your back but still keep a level head to stop you from your most foolish endeavors. You want them to love you but not be blind to your failings. To support you but not enable you. Etc, etc, etc.

The whole idea of being able to write down a couple nouns and staple them to somebody and say ""This is you in every interaction you will ever face"" is to make a human one dimensional.

What this leads him to doing is basically whatever the fuck what he wants on the weekends. Then, he is coming to you on the boring days, and getting all he wants. I specifically asked how the sex was due to the fact that if he was getting constant sex from you during the weekdays why would he ever want this relationship to change? I don't know if there are other perks to dating you during the weekday, but if you are cooking for him, or doing anything else like that there is more reasons why he wouldn't want it to change.

Now... ""But when you see pics your guy kissing some chick on the cheek multiple times, or holding her close, it pisses you off just a little."" Of course it pisses you off. We don't know if he is cheating on you, and do you ever see him those nights he is partying with those girls?

He is clearly not okay with you hanging out in the group.

Now here is the honest, but somewhat brutal truth: You are an awesome girl who is doing everything you can to be that awesome girlfriend.

Are you worried that you won't be able to find someone better?

Geopolitical notes from India
M D Nalapat

Delhi is the nest of no fewer than six dozen international arms dealers, and they are the most desirable of friends to have in the national capital of what is effectively the world’s fourth-largest economy. Every week, each of them throws at least one if not more parties, at which liquor flows in the same profusion was water into bathtubs. The pot-bellied, ageing politicians and civil servants - now joined by a smattering of those in uniform - in attendance do not bring their wives along, for in such gatherings, there are numerous charming young ladies who attach themselves to the powerful attendees throughout the evening. What they whisper into the ancient, unsightly ears of the senior civil servants, select military brass and politician is not known, but whatever it be, the honeyed tone is effective. 

Contract after contract gets awarded in profusion to the lucky hosts, who are usually called upon to design tender specifications in such a way that only their chosen candidate will get selected. The name of the game is to frame the rules and the conditions in such a way that the rest of the pack gets eliminated Thus, in the selection of the $11 billion contract for the MMRCA (Medium Multi-role Combat Aircraft) ,the single-engined Saab Gripen was excluded “because it has a single engine and is therefore less safe than twin-engined aircraft”. The reality, of course, is that statistics show that twin-engined combat aircraft are no safer than those with single engines. Saab being bankrupt, the entire company could have been bought over for the price of the 126-aircraft deal, thereby enabling India to gain access to advanced technology as well as providing it with a platform that can enable Delhi to enter the field of sale of defense aircraft, the way China is already doing.

In contrast, the Dassault Rafaele (which key circles in Delhi had told this columnist was the chosen craft, nine months before the selection was made public) involves no significant transfer of technology. The company remains French, and has indeed been saved from financial collapse by the huge Indian order, although no other country in the world has bought the Rafaele, save its captive market, France. Even the GCC countries, who are normally very obliging in such matters, have not touched the Rafaele, despite strenous efforts by the Sarkozy government to get them to buy the aircraft. However,the French President has succeeded in India, perhaps because of the persuasive abilities of his Italian-born wife Carla, who shares such roots with the all-powerful Congress President, Sonia (Maino) Gandhi France is indeed experiencing a bonanza from India. Not only has it managed to rescue Dassault through the MMRCA purchase (which flouts commonsense, because the Rafaele is comprehensively inferior to the fifth-generation aircraft being developed by China), but a total of more than $6 billion has been spent on purchasing French submarines, again vessels that are no match for the nuclear-powered vessels of the PLA Navy. 

Although there have been numerous corruption allegations against key French companies such as Thales, this has not prevented them from landing juicy contracts in India, a country where French women are much admired for their proficiency in aerobic exercises. As icing on the cake, in telecom as well as in the field of nuclear reactors, other French enterprises have landed, or are in the process of finalising, contracts worth several billion dollars each. The common link in all that is that the money for such expenditure comes from the Indian taxpayer. Clearly a case of the poor feeding the rich, in that India could have had a flourishing defense production industry, if its policymakers had not been determined to acquire only foreign platforms and systems. For more than three decades, successive governments have talked of “indigenisation”, but in 2012,more than 81% of critical defense equipment is sourced from foreign suppliers, even trucks, of which the private sector in India is an international supplier. You will find Tata or Leyland or Mahindra vehicles in much greater profusion in foreign countries than in the Indian military, which wears a distinctly foreign look.

In the most expensive beauty parlours of Delhi or Mumbai, where an hour can cost more than $300, you can find the wives and daughters of not only politicians, officials and businesspersons (the usual suspects) but of senior military brass. Indeed, the lifestyles of some of the retired senior brass of the three services is such as would rival that of a prince, complete with multiple airconditioners and Audi and BMW cars littering the garages. Of course, nobody from the Income-tax department asks just how a retired military officer can afford such luxuries on his pension. For the record, they form “consultancy” companies. In common with the wives of senior officials and politicians, who earn huge “consultancy” fees without having knowledge of anything other kitty parties, the spouses of certain military officers have substantial income from companies that apparently pay them to go twice a week to the beauty parlour. The lifestyles of some retired super-senior military officers is clearly too opulent for them to have made the money they spend ethically, and yet no action gets taken against them. 

After all, they are just joining a very populous club, that of crooked officers and politicians, that include some of the biggest names in Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has become a figure of fun in social media, with acerbic comments about his incapacity (if not unwillingness) to take action to stem graft. Another honest but ineffective individual is Defense Minister A K Antony, who presides over a ministry that is among the most corrupt in the country. Now they are under pressure, and all because of an honest officer who refused to go the way of some of his predecessors and amass wealth. The present Chief of Army Staff, General V K Singh, is a misfit in a post where there are so many opportunities for enrichment, and so much punishment in case one remains honest. He has gone public about being offered a $3 million bribe by a vehicle manufacturer, and has proof of the offer in the form of tapes. However, what is likely is that the CBI, the Central Bureau of Investigation ( more correctly known as the Congress Bureau of Intimidation) will doctor and destroy the tapes given to them, so as to enable well-connected fixers and lobbyists to escape. The CBI is unlikely to undertake a genuine probe into what may be called India’s Armsgate scam, for fear of angering politicians at the very top of national life.

In India, an “honest” government is that where only 50% of decisions get auctioned to the highest (illegal) bidder, while the rest get taken based on official perceptions of public need. A “crooked” government is where 70% of decisions get auctioned and only 30% get taken for reasons of perceived public interest. In Sonia Gandhi’s India, the estimate is that the central government auctions 90% of decisions,leaving only 10% to be decided on grounds of merit. It is this intolerable spike in corruption that has finally roused a usually somnolent public to fury. Of course ,the arms merchants and their beneficiaries are fighting back, smearing the names of whistle-blowers and using the legal system to file frivolous and vexatious litigation to stop them from uncovering or reporting on graft. General Singh is under attack not only by the riuling parties but by the Opposition. After all, when they were in power, they too fed at the same filthy trough as those on the ruling side are now doing. However, the tide seems to be turning against them. One after the other, facts are tumbling out. By standing up against corruption in the Defense Ministry, General V K Singh is helping to make India more secure.

Gonna be honest here. The biggest issue is your SO's breach of trust. Her boyfriend told her something private that she should not have told you. People should be able to respect each other's privacy, and 100% honesty does not mean that she tells you all her partner's secrets.

&gt; it still bothers me that he would not be completely up front about the situation when we have very graciously allowed him into our love life.

Whoa. People do not have an obligation to tell you all their secrets. And it's a mutual relationship between him and your SO. It's not as if you are doing him a favor. It sounds really arrogant to say you've ""very graciously"" allowed him into your love life, so he has some duty to break confidence about the affair and tell you something that's none of your business.

It would be nice if everyone was open and honest, but in the real world, things are a lot more complicated than that. You don't know the details of the married woman's relationship, and it's not your place to judge what she's doing.

Maybe he's making the marriage work. Maybe he's *saving* the marriage. Without knowing the details, you can't really say that.

"c42gvab","It's unscientific because it makes many strong claims about the physical world yet gives evidence for none of it, and real science has constantly rejected it. It's not scientifically tested, and the whole thing has constantly avoided scientific analysis because that's how pseudoscience works. It's a hopeful lie that closely mimics scientific terminology in order to make it look trustowrthy to people who don't know any better. It promises vague and unlimited rewards of happiness, another glaring clue of pseudoscience.

&gt;    By carrying out a process called ""auditing"", a person could be regressed through his engrams to re-experiencing past experiences. This enabled engrams to be ""cleared"". The subject, who would now be in a state of ""Clear"", would have a perfectly functioning mind with an improved IQ and photographic memory.[140] The ""Clear"" would be cured of physical ailments ranging from poor eyesight to the common cold,[141] which Hubbard asserted were purely psychosomatic.

Everything in here is untrue. None of it is confirmed by anything in valid science, and in fact goes directly against a lot of it. There is no photographic memory to be unlocked, nor a mental state of nirvana that might be called ""clear"". Physical illnesses may be partly psychosomatic, but the ones listed there are still strongly physical. Claims about the world must be openly, honestly, rigourously tested in order to be found valid. This is called science, and it isn't some secret elitist society that chooses knowledge on a whim.

&gt;MISTRANSLATIONS – Actual study of the painstaking details put into translation efforts are inspiring.  Scribes would destroy an entire scroll if one word was spelled wrong because they did not want future editions to be compromised.

This is not entirely true. SOME groups did this, but it's just as likely that the dominant form of belief at the time was incorporated into traditional documents. There are obvious differences from the Samaritan bible and the Hebrew bible, there are differences between the LXX and the Dead Sea Scrolls.

&gt;ORIGINAL TEXTS / ERRORS – Although we do not have original texts in the author’s hand, we do have over 5000 complete or partial copies of the originals, and they all agree in amazing detail to each other.  The addition of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the 1950s solidified these other copies.

These are not the original versions. We have copies that predate the versions from which original translations were done, but these are by no means the original copies. 

&gt;FAIRY TALES -  This is just an excuse.  There is no evidence for this other than the arguer not willing to accept supernatural events.  The original authors of these texts would have been considered radical and many were put to death.  They would had no other motive to write then from the divine.

This idea that they were ""radical"" depends on the time period. Not all of the Biblical authors fall into that category. 

I'm not even going to deal with the contradictions part because that's a whole other ballgame. 

Your idea of ""real, honest science"" is contextualized to be ""real and honest"" only through a Christian apologetic lens. This does not mean that it's ""real, honest science"". Real, honest science contradicts young earth creationism at every turn. It may not be ""honest"", but only if honesty is judged from a Christian perspective. Please do not construe honesty with Christianity because the two are not necessarily the same.

2) Your parents' relationship probably was not as solid as people (including you and your sister) may have thought. Believe it or not, ""cheating"" is usually a two way street. He was unhappy, not getting what he needed from the relationship, or possibly has his own issues that he could not/would not discuss. Your mother may or may not have seen what was going on (if there were issues/or he was unhappy and not getting what he needed) and ignored it, or she may not have seen it at all. The lack of communication only compounds things. Of course, neither you or I are your parents, so we don't really know what's going on in their heads, not 100% (nor should we).

3) Emotions are never wrong. You are angry, hurt, and feel betrayed, yes? Do what you can to work through those emotions, but know that they are not wrong and do not need to be justified. That said, your father is still your father, and was during the time of his affair. The only thing that changed is that he opened up more to his family and admitted to something that was likely eating a hole in him. Somewhere inside, he also likely hoped his family would still love him and be supportive, though it's doubtful he expected it. 

4) As to what do you do now? Talk with your family. Be open and honest but also be careful of your words. Words can inflict a lot of damage, and be just as scarring--albeit mental--as a physical damage. Let your dad know how you feel. 

5) Yes, my family has. My mother is a sex addict and has cheated on both my father and my step father *many* times. All those ""Yo Mama"" jokes might as well be about my mother. However, we recognize that she has issues, and needs, that were not being met. Granted, the addiction to sex was just one of many problems (depression, repressed memories from abuse and rape, mania, and a slue of other disorders). She is now on medication and that helps her to maintain her control and a ""normal"" life. She still needs hugs. She still needs to laugh and feel loved and appreciated. She's still my mother and despite all the shit she has put my family through--believe me, it's a lot--I still love her. 

6) Be there for your mother and sister. Make sure there is an open line of communication. I would suggest you do the same for your father, but that might not be possible for some time, if ever. It's up to you and him.

"c3pa3za","Hello there, yours seems like quite a unique situation, so I'll try answer it relating to my own experiences. I was raised by (very lenient) Catholic parents, but growing up I was exposed to Spiritualism as well as certain facets of Paganism and New Age movement both from literature my mum kept around the house, and my best friend (whose family was Spiritualist).

Coming from a Catholic background, the appeal of New Age/Paganism can be very strong, many of the symbols and rituals to do with church-going are present (and 'purer'?) in these religions/movements, so the leap is not very high. The community is also very welcoming, very lenient, and allows you to create your own beliefs according to what you value and what importance you place on different aspects, without dictating ""No, *this* is what a Pagan does/believes, if you don't do this you will be judged and punished"". Your mum has probably found a lot of comfort in this and perhaps feels that she's able to now take charge of her own spiritual self, and formulate her own opinions. Perhaps it's also something to do with control. From the sound of your post, however, it sounds like you've already come to this conclusion.

The best thing you can do is to be honest but graceful. Admit freely that you're uncomfortable with her chosen spirituality, but assure her that it's not because you think that *she* or the faith *itself* is stupid, wrong, misguided etc... but because you, *yourself* are not sure where you stand with your *own* spirituality. Because you've been raised exposed to different religious paths, you're still exploring and have not yet made up your mind, and as such you'd prefer not to cast a (predominantly) New Age outlook on your own explorations. Tell her that you're happy she's found something she can relate to, but that you are still looking for your own thing to relate to, and while yes, you are not discarding what she believes, you'd also like to remain open to other options. 

As long as she's not being taken advantage of, she's free to follow what she likes, but you yourself are also free to remain separate from that if you so choose. Tell her it's a touchy subject for you, but encourage her to reach out to like-minded individuals (so she has an outlet), and hopefully that should keep everyone happy enough.

(from weakest to strongest) Lecithin, Phospatidylcholine, Choline (Chloride, Bitartart, Citrate), DMAE, Centrophenoxine, CDP-Choline, Alpha GPC.

Thus, ""choline"" was long understood to meant either choline chloride, choline bitartrate, or choline citrate. All of which are the same level of choline just minor different in side-effects. I don't believe a ""raw"" choline existed. 

5:1 seem excessive to me, unless you meant Alpha-GPC: Piracetam (then I agree. It is more like 4:1. But minor differences.).

"c3le0ze","I'm going to copy and paste a response to this from a previous thread:

I was diagnosed with HSV2 last year after I had a one-time fling with a guy I never had sex with. He rubbed his genitals on mine and boom, I got it. It's been tough and you'll never really be able to fully understand where she's coming from unless you experience it yourself. Understand that. Realize that she's dealing with a heavily socially stigmatized condition but at the same time don't feel pity towards her.

I've had sexual relationships since then (I was a virgin when I got it) and to my knowledge, I might have passed it once but that's before I knew. Since my diagnosis, I've taken extra measures to make sure I don't pass it (and I haven't). if you decide to continue this relationship, know that fulfilling sex is still totally possible. It might have to be tweaked a bit but it's not the end of the world. The main thing is use a condom and don't have genital contact while she has an outbreak. Also, keep in mind that HSV1 genitally is a bit ""better"", since that strand of the virus doesn't really like the genitals so she will probably have lesser and shorter outbreaks than if she had HSV2 genitally.

In terms of your relationship and how you view her, be honest but gentle. Understand that this is a big deal but also be honest with yourself. If you don't think you can handle this, end it. Don't stay with her out of pity or because its ""the right thing to do"". You have the right to not want to deal with this, but she also has the right to find someone who will. Staying with her because you don't want to hurt her and because you think you can convince yourself to be okay with it in the future isnt fair to either of you.

I've had one guy reject me because of it but he didn't have the guts to end it. He just ignored me ad started seeing someone else until I got the point. Don't do this.

"c3elqd9","&gt;other options that would allow me to gently distance myself from my loved ones that that, instead of being a burden for the rest of my life, I can take the ""rip off the band aid"" approach?

A monastery could be an option for you. It's also worth noting that Buddhism is a non-theistic religion. I haven't looked much into it, but many of the practices of meditation seem to genuinely be helpful with my fatigue (or, at least, with clearing my mind and helping me ""take it,"" I suppose). I look into it off and on, and you could definitely consider trying to find a Buddhist group somewhere that has a mission statement you can get behind, even without being religious.

Unfortunately, though, I don't think there's really a great answer for you (I haven't found one for myself). We're tired people, and we don't have the energy levels (or if we do at the time, we likely don't have the stamina) that most people have, so we can't do many of the tasks that others can. Would you mind perhaps sharing in which ways you feel you are a burden (as the type of burden you feel you are changes the type of response that would be most beneficial for someone to recommend)?

&gt;Finding a line of work that will drag me to remote parts of the world, but will also allow me to work on my own schedule

I'd seen that I upvoted you once before (Reddit Enhancement Suite keeps track of these details; the comment was from about 4 months ago, and in this sub-reddit) and skimmed through your comment history to try to find it. I saw the video you uploaded about spinning a pen in your hands (something I am probably going to start practicing today, by the way, I've always wanted to do this), and YouTube also informs me that you are or were involved in performing arts. How many connections do you have within the field? This is a long-shot (but aren't all of our attempts?), but do you think you might be able to find a playhouse somewhere in the country where you could live in a small living area somewhere in the building and help with some of the productions as much as you were able in exchange? I know it's hardly a great recommendation, but I feel at a loss.

&gt;at least it would prevent me from causing an increasing amount of damage through meeting and getting close to new people who will then develop expectations

It is not your responsibility to safeguard future relationships, and you don't have to take that burden on yourself. When you meet other people, they will get to know you. They can decide whether or not it's ""worth"" being friends with you, and if you are willing to give people some space, knowing that your condition can be a lot to take in and consider for others, you should be okay. If you are honest with them and they build unrealistic or impossible expectations, they are doing you a disservice -- not the other way around.

&gt;what is the etiquette of making new friends or flirting with girls?

GO FOR IT. You're not, primarily, a disabled person. You are, primarily, a person: a human being -- and from the little glimpse YouTube/Reddit gave me, a human being very capable of laughter, irony, and compassion; an open-minded individual who would probably make a great friend. Just because most people have $100 in their figurative wallet doesn't mean the figurative $40 in your wallet can't be enough for an amazing date. You are not defined by your disability, and there are many people out there capable of seeing you for who you are (""a good person at heart, [you] promise [us]""). It isn't your responsibility (and, frankly, isn't your right) to make decisions for others. I still recommend trying to turn the tables. If someone you loved fell ill, how would you feel if they were also distraught over their guilt, and then they ran off claiming that they were acting in your best interest. Wouldn't it be your right to decide what was in your own best interest? Perhaps I don't know enough about your situation or those around you, but I just can't imagine those who love you wouldn't be suffering even more to know that you were experiencing this and considering cutting all ties in order to be free from your feelings of guilt. If your primary motivation is to avoid causing them pain, suffering, or discomfort by ""having to deal with you,"" have you considered how much pain and suffering they might go through upon learning that you were so burdened by your fear of disturbing them that you had to cut ties and leave? I'm not saying cutting ties and leaving isn't the best decision for you -- just that it seems you would end up doing the very thing you're trying to avoid, just with a new twist on it to make it feel a little different.

As far as ""rules"" for social etiquette that I use, I'm just honest, but I try not to overwhelm people. I say as much as needs to be said (and I don't mean this in a duplicitous sense). If I make plans to have somebody over for dinner, I let them know ahead of time that there's always a possibility I will have to cancel near the last-minute if my fatigue is too much to handle, or that I may need some flexibility (i.e. the ability to push dinner back by 30-45 minutes so I can lie down before they arrive). This seems to work well for me, and people are generally very understanding. I especially enjoy being able to have others over for dinner, because I can pace myself preparing the meal, and it's one of the few things that I can do to feel as though I am really contributing to the evening. My best friend since the 7th grade comes over to my place 8x as often as I go to his. I've been working through a lot of issues regarding my family and my fundamentalist upbringing, so I haven't been especially social lately, but when I get back in the game, I'd like to have people over for dinner more often. Look to the abilities and capabilities that you do have, in spite of your fatigue, and think about how you can utilize them to contribute to the relationships that you are in. You seem like a great guy to be around, and even if it's true that this is only one version of Andrew, and there are other less savory versions, that's something that many people are okay with and understand. Perhaps some people cannot, or perhaps some people are at a point in their lives where they don't believe they can, but others can, and they probably want to.

Again, on the 'etiquette,' by sharing simply that you have chronic fatigue and may need your plans to be somewhat flexible, you're able to communicate that there is something different about you (and, thus, about their prospective relationship with you), and in a way that I think is honest and appropriate. So long as you are being honest, you don't have to be worried about telling others to ""not get too attached."" If you are honest with them, and if you keep your communication open with them, then they will get to know you and will understand what your life is like. It is their decision to decide how attached to get to you, and you shouldn't prohibit them based on your fear of feeling guilty or rejected if they decide they can't. I often find that I take the responsibility of the world on my own shoulders, and I have to be reminded that this is not only unnecessary, but unhealthy both for myself and for those closest to me. I don't know if this advice is helpful or applicable to you; perhaps it's only beneficial for the specific set of conditions and circumstances that I am in, but I hope you find some encouragement in it.",1325881695,"again, on the 'etiquette,' by sharing simply that you have chronic fatigue and may need your plans to be somewhat flexible, you're able to communicate that there is something different about you (and, thus, about their prospective relationship with you), and in a way that i think is honest and appropriate.","honest and appropriate","honest",NA,FALSE,"honest and appropriate","appropriate",NA,NA,1

"c39wzfn","That's pretty much exactly what I say when the situation calls for it, though you have to admit, you *know* she's gonna interpret that a certain way. You're basicallly telling her ""You can easily be that person, I just don't know yet."" You're technically being honest, but the line generally works because the girl gets some false hope from it. A lot of times for me, I already know I don't plan on being with her for long (or even for more than a night), but I say that line to comfort her.

Then there've also been a bunch of girls who were just giving me token resistance, and they had the exact same mindset as me- they didn't plan on dating me (they just wanted sex), yet they asked about my intentions because they didn't want to look like a slut. And I gave them that line because it was technically true and built comfort, and then when I wanted to see them again, they were just like ""Nope, sorry."" 

People on the internet can feel free to spew all this bullshit about being totally honest and shit, but real life tends to work differently. That same line is something I hear from girls too, even when I know that's not actually what they mean. All these people on reddit tend to assume the world can be awesome if you're just open and honest about shit, and those people usually have little to no experience with the real world. If being totally open/honest is something that turns girls off (and it does, a lot), then why the fuck would I do that?! Why would it even be an option if the real world shows you something different? 

Like other people often say, why play games? Well, you play ""games"" because that's how social interaction works. If you tried to be honest about wanting to fuck a girl right off the bat, you'll get turned down 95% of the time. So you have to play *some* sort of game to even have a shot.

I would prefer reviewers to be fair and honest, but offer — for lack of a better term — appropriate constructive criticism. As a scholar or someone with a background in whatever genre you are reviewing, you should at least be able to find *one or two* good things about the piece. 

If this was your personal blog, then by all means go ahead… but a vitriolic screed will not cut it when you are getting paid to review a work.

Take the notorious [William Logan](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2002/01/versed_nightmare.single.html) for example: he is a savage critic — but he's also a scholar who is contributing to the culture of writing by making important points about the craft.

Until someone can say about your reviews, as they do about Logan,

&gt;That's what's most valuable about Logan's criticism—the sincerity of his praise. Logan does, periodically and grudgingly, give positive reviews, and it's impossible to distrust a compliment that's coming through clenched teeth. His recommendation means something.

Then you should try and be evenhanded in your reviews. If you've taken any sort of fine arts classes in college or graduate school, you should be able to find a little praise for any work… we've all been there in a workshop.

Paul's embrace of full on big-L Libertarianism doesn't speak well for his ability to think.  He's either stupidly short-sighted, blinded by greed, or flat out insane -- there's no other reasons I can really see for someone to embrace that ideology once they actually even partially understand it.  (Please note the distinction from small-l libertarianism.  There's a huge difference between wanting to trim away some of the government's excessive or more poorly conceived regulations and going full Rand.  The first, I can understand and even agree with to some extent, though often it'll break down when it comes to _which_ regulations and programs should be cut back.  As for the second....Don't go full Rand. You never go full Rand.....)

As for the donor problem, that's a huge issue, but it's one that can be at least partially addressed by reforming election laws to minimize donor influence and things like reversing Citizen's United to knock the corporations and their sustained, massive wealth and the influence that comes with it largely out of the political game.  Will we ever be able to do it?  I don't know.  OWS and the public sentiment driving it gives me some hope we'll get there, but it's not what I'd call hugely likely.  And even if we do manage reforms on the worst of the issues involved, there's really no way to build a system that consistently rewards the truly honest politicians over their less-honest compatriots.

During some renovation (which did actually occur while my wife was working there) some long-forgotten documents are discovered in the Vault. The protagonist quickly realizes that the documents are the missing 116 pages of the Book of Mormon, and they contain some controversial/damaging (but un-revealed to the readers till later, in true Dan Brown style) information. He is torn on whether it is his duty to honesty to reveal them, or his duty to the church to suppress them.

* Antagonist #1: An over-the-top literal believing member, who upon discovering the history of the Danites, feels he has been called of God to be a modern Danite. (He is actually mentally disturbed, but his worldview fits conveniently within an orthodox and literal interpretation of Mormonism.)

* Antagonist #2: A fictional apostle after the style of Bruce R McConkie or  Boyd K. Packer. This character will be tricky to pull off because he needs to be an unwitting villain in that he truly believes that he's doing the right thing. In order to not turn-off believers, he can't be written as an unsympathetic character. But, with a mindset of ""Not all things that are true, are helpful"" and a willingness to suppress unfavorable information, combined with the delusional Antagonist #1, the stage is set for a fun story, with real-life scenarios of morality, truth, and the danger of religious belief.",1318617097,"characters:  * protagonist: a sincere and honest (but believing), upper-level church authority who is involved in over-seeing the granite mountain records vault.","sincere and honest","honest",NA,FALSE,"sincere and honest","sincere",NA,NA,0
"c2q9u78","She may not be physically cheating, since he's on another continent, but she's at least emotionally cheating.  And as long as she's got emotional ties to this guy, she's not going to be 100% emotionally invested in fixing your marriage.  Get a marriage counselor.  Tell her that you feel like she's holding back on her commitment because of her continuing and lingering ties to this guy.

Her saying that the other guy has some flaws that would make her not want to be with him... yeah, that's really not a strong endorsement for saying it's through between the two of them.  That makes it sound more like maybe if these things didn't ""stand in their way"" then she just might give it a go.

It's not fair to you that she keeps emailing the guy she had an affair with.  That she can't see that is troubling me.  That she can't see how her continued relationship with him, even without sex, is an unfair burden to your marriage.  She needs to give one of you up.

"c2oqom9","&gt;Dawkins confirmed his disdain for feminism when he criticized a feminist atheist for her concern about being sexually harrassed in an elevator 

This is an overly broad characterization of what happened. I have no idea why Dawkins felt like he had to post his comment on PZ's blog, it was over the top and out of line, but it does not ""confirm his distain"". Rebecca W. was just pointing out to guys they should think twice before extending an 4 AM room invitation to a woman confined alone in an elevator. A reasonable observation.

From that point on, both sides acted poorly. Richard D. never should have responded, or if he did something like ""it probably was not a wise move, but on the scale of things it is pretty low"" Richard would not acknowledge that in his post, he immediately dug in and ranted about Muslima.

It would have been best for everyone to take a chill pill at that point. Watson could have said ""nice over reaction, Dick. I was just offering friendly advice"". But no. Minions on both sides sprung into action and we had month long shit storm.

I am not sure what the breakdown is, but from my reading, for every female atheist blogger attacking RD, he was being supported by another female atheist blogger. Both sides got carried away and way over reacted. Dawkins started it and he never apologized. Two strikes there. But there was an unyielding backlash and RW did not try to calm people down.

The community may benefit from the intense open discussion as many were forced to face the issue of female under representation in the skeptic/atheist community, but a price was paid. Rational discourse, open and honest, but tempered would have served better.

"c2ooyl7","Guy in similar situation here. My gf is not grossly overweight but she always compliments my body and it feels shit that I don't like hers nearly as much as she likes mine. She has actually started to make an effort now.

There are two ways you can approach this: a) gentle, subtle hints to her that are obvious enough that she realises you want her to get in shape b) directly talking to her. I used a). It actually wasn't working that well at the start so I became less than gentle ie occasionally teasing her about the food she eats and how she always says she's going to do exercise but doesn't. It worked but I wouldn't recommend it - it was out of frustration and wasn't that healthy for our relationship. If this happens to me again I'd do b) if a) didn't work.

Just as a finishing note, remember that self-esteems are at stake. Try to be firm and honest but still tactful.

I really do go into therapy with the intent of being completely open and honest but there are some issues I've needed to deal with that, until recently, I believed I was incapable of speaking aloud about. Not reticent or unwilling, incapable. After a lifetime of misplaced shame and guilt, misdirection became a reflex, not something I did intentionally.

I have a lot of hope for the next time because I no longer feel incapable of talking about the things I did before. Funny story: I was having a drunken heart to heart with close friend about our respective childhoods and it just slipped out. Obviously my reflexes weren't working so well because I was drunk. I didn't care at the moment, also because I was drunk, but I woke up the next morning thinking ""OMG did I really tell him that!""

"c28xykb","Hey there, sorry to hear all this.

To answer your questions with what I know-
1-Do you value your psychiatrist/therapist a lot? Maybe ask them for cognitive therapy, meds won't change you, just regulate you or make it easier to bring out what's already inside.
2-I dunno much about that, sorry, I'm sure someone else would be able to help you. (Not in college yet)
3-It can be hard to be honest, but I think it's generally better to be. If you just rather not talk about something, say so. Do you think any of them are true friends? Or have the potential to be? The inappropriate touching is something you'll want to save for people you can truly trust. I do believe it's had to have had some effect on you, considering you remember it and it's on your mind. I'm glad it stopped before it got out of hand.
4-Don't push too hard, a night club might be a little out of the question, and besides, don't force yourself to do something you don't like. But yes, hobbies, especially arts may be good for you! Do you like painting and photography?

Alright, well, besides your questions;
When I was younger I never understood the phrase ""money can't buy happiness."" But now that I'm a little older, I think I understand. Money is an almost entirely superficial thing. Besides your basic needs and having some genuine fun, it won't bring anyone much farther internally. I think what you need is a higher sense of empathy; really just the ability to react to somebody's emotional expressions (whether it be body language, them telling you something emotional or you being able to ""sense"" something isn't right) with compassion, understanding and/or your own emotions. 

I say this because I think empathy is really all one needs to be sensitive, affectionate and honest. I know it's not easy, but you can't put people on pedestals or conversely, under you. It's all about ego. We're all humans. Happy people are only a few steps forward from suffering. Those happy people you see, well, some of them may have been in similar situations to you. Some of them may currently be in those situations. You never know. Also, I don't think you overemphasized this or were trying to be arrogant in saying ""I'm smarter than most of the people here"", but I don't think that's good. I mean, we probably all get that feeling sometimes, but in the end, it doesn't matter. Pure intelligence is something almost everyone has, whether they use it right or wrong, embrace it or ignore it, lose or gain some of it, but in most cases, we only lose it to our egos. 

May I ask what your hobbies and interests are?

Personally, though whether I am right or wrong is up to you, I think you need more understanding in your life. Human connection doesn't lie in others but rather yourself. I think when summed up, the things that really make us happy are:
1-Making others happy-People will tell you that's not true, but I think at our cores it is, a lot of us just lose this realization or never find it.
2-Empathy-To understand is to gain.

It's totally up to you, but I'd like it if you at least considered reading some stuff on Buddhism (Specifically an easy book of the Dalai Lama's teachings would be nice, they're no Buddhist-centric, just his views on life), Meditation and as ridiculous as it may sound, maybe some teen reading. It sounds like you missed out on some of your teen life, which I think is important in understanding empathy. Try Perks Of Being a Wallflower. It's probably well under your reading level, but I think it's a beautiful story. Also try and dabble in whatever creativity you can. I think arts of all kinds, whether they be music, writing, drawing, etc. are just raw conduits of human emotion being released into a medium.

I hope I've helped in some way. Please, take care and be happy. Good luck with everything!

"c254iwb","Well, pain could either be really good or really bad. If it's cancer, that means it's progressed pretty far. But if there is cancer in her family I would think she would get tested on occasion, so it probably wouldn't have had enough time to get that far. More often, when there is pain, it means it is NOT cancer. I don't know why the doctors didn't tell her this. 

I go for mammograms regularly. Cancer is in my family as well and I have cysts that are cause for concern. They would even remove them now, but I would like to hang on to my breasts if I can. Thing is, after finding out, it gave me the time to accept that I may not have breats some day, and at that point I can choose to buy new ones or to proudly display my war scars. I'm not afraid anymore :). Your mom will reach that point too, if it's necessary. It takes time and people not making this out to be the end of the world, she has enough of those bad thoughts already.

I would of course not recommend pretending nothing is wrong, be honest, but positive. 

Worst case, she has cancer. We've made amazing advancements, and cancer is rarely a death sentence anymore (although it still is, lost a family member last year). I have several friends that have recovered from cancer. All they needed was friend to treat them normally, someone who didn't treat them like an invalid and victim. They just wanted normalcy. They got through it, and now they've all come out the other side as the happiest and most positive people I know.

My mom was one of the people in my life that did have cancer, I'm the one that turned out to not have cancer. I saw both sides directly, and we both came out the other side. Whichever scenario plays out, just be her daughter :)

"c243te8","You don't need to use lead to avoid tin whiskers.  I've worked in the electronics industry. You might get tin whiskers if you use an immersion tin finish on the board and a tin solder for the assembly, but you don't need to do that to get a RoHS compliant product. There are immersion gold, immersion silver, and other leadfree solder finishes available. Contemporary leadfree solder alloys don't have the same kind of problems with tin whiskers as earlier ones. Reflow heating should be preformed as well. Effective conformal coating can also reduce the risk of whisker growth. Another issue is that many vendors lie or don't properly track how their components are made. Don't trust the sales people! Test your parts yourself to make sure that they comply with the specs that you ordered.

"c243dx9","Sine you are trolling I doubt you want to hear a serious answer to you question but I will provide it anyway:

Religious folk are not evil. Cray, right? Hearing that on an ""atheist"" reddit. But seriously. When I think about the number of people I have met who are are upstanding, honest people who are just plain fun to be around and douchbags I don't want to waste my time with I must admit that the majority of the good ones hold some form of spiritual faith. In my opinion, if faith gives you moral courage and integrity, it is a good thing and, in light of the alternative, worth the sacrifice of approaching reality in a rational manner. In short, RELIGION is beneficial for many, many people. 
However, ORGANIZED RELIGION, has very few redeeming qualities, in my opinion. Of all the western organized religions, the Mormons are the only ones i can think of off the top of my head that don't have blood on their hands and that's a statement that needs to be taken with a grain of salt since both the old and new testaments are a part of their scripture. I think we can all agree that the three so-called ""desert religions"" Christianity, Islam, and Judaism have oceans of bloodshed, endless corruption, and just plain ol' evil in their background. That's not to say that the people observing those faiths are bad. Quite the opposite. I know many people from all three denominations that are by far morally superior to others without any faith at all. The problem is that in any group of people large enough there are knuckleheads. And having faith, by definition, means following blindly without question. Could something horrible happen in an organization that happens to be populated by a dishonest minority and a majority of honest, but unquestioning followers? I think the Crusades, the Spanish inquisition, and countless cases of genocide, molestation, and fraud speak for themselves.
The problem with people who do not think for themselves is that, while they may have incorruptible faith, they are more susceptible to the will of the corrupted because, unfortunately scriptures were not handed down from heaven, prophets were not touched by god, and religion is not immaculate. Religion is the product of men and men, by nature, are fallible. 
So to answer your question: there is no argument. Under the premises that the actions of an organization characterize the morality of its members and that these charities are in spirit what they are in name, there is no valid argument that can be made for the nature of religious folk being evil. So what, then, is the cause of the contradiction between the answer to your question and the documented acts of evil committed in the name of religion? Simply this: people may or may not be evil, but the chances of an organization harboring at least some evil people is directly proportional to the size of the organization. And I think we can all agree that Organized Religion refers to a very large group of people. Because of this, the actions of the organization can swing both ways, in the hands of good leaders you get charity; in the hands of evil leaders you get slaughter.

I know you admit you're open, direct, and honest, but now is *really* not the time for that. If anything, put *one* of those things into the ""...willing to admit"" section.

Use it as an opportunity to reveal something *interesting* about yourself (""quiet intensity"", ""inviting curl playing about my lips"", etc.) or, at the very least, co-opt it into a different section (e.g. favorite quotes, likes/dislikes, hobbies).

To OP: I'll post this here, since I'm also not gay and don't want to dilute the thread if those are the responses you're looking for.

Dealing with a Lying and Cheating Spouse
Initially, most people approach the topic of lying and infidelity somewhat reluctantly - driven by their curiosity or by a recent, unexpected discovery. 

For better or for worse, our romantic relationships are not always as straightforward as we would like them to be. From time to time, our intimate relationships can become complicated and complex - full of contradictions and inconsistencies. 

When it comes to love and marriage, people expect a spouse to be completely honest. But, at the same time, everyone values their sense of freedom and privacy. So while romantic partners typically want to please each other, at other times, couples experience competing goals which can make telling the truth more difficult (see, when lovers lie). 

As it stands, our close relationships involve a lot of truth telling as well as some dishonesty. 

If love was straightforward and unchanging, that would be easy to acknowledge. But, when you take a close look at the nature of love and romance, one thing becomes clear: Love creates both happiness and heartache, opportunities and constraints, joy and sorrow.

For the most part, spouses are considerate, honest and kind (see, healthy relationships). But at the same time, husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, betray those they love. Unfortunately, deception comes in handy when people want to limit their partner's choices, avoid conflict or punishment, or when people want to influence their partner's behavior. 

And while it is not uncommon for people to lie and cheat, it is difficult to accept that one's own husband or wife might be doing so (see, cheating spouse). Who hasn't caught a boyfriend or girlfriend lying only to have him or her deny it - ""I would never lie to you."" 

Not only can our close relationships sometimes cause heartache and anxiety, but it's also difficult to discuss lying and cheating out in the open. When you mention the possibility that love and betrayal might go hand-in-hand, people tend to get angry or they become defensive. 

We know how disheartening it is to deal with these issues. But, disheartening or not, deception and infidelity are important to understand. 

As such, this website provides an opportunity to explore this fundamental, but rarely discussed aspect of our intimate relationships: How to deal with a lying and cheating spouse.

Even in the best of circumstances, it can be difficult to know what to believe. Many people struggle with their suspicions and concerns (see - for facts and advice on a cheating husband or a cheating wife). 

For example, people often wonder...

Is my husband just being flirtatious or could he be tempted to cheat?
When I ask my wife a question, why doesn't she look me in the eye?
How come my girlfriend doesn't answer her phone?
Why is my partner working so late?
What's causing my boyfriend be so distant lately?
Is there an innocent explanation for everything that happens? Or could you simply be reading too much into what's going on? Unfortunately, the truth is not always easy to discern (see, signs of a cheating spouse). 

And actually having to investigate a spouse can quickly turn into a never-ending challenge. More often than not, this happens because a cheating spouse will rarely admit the truth even when confronted with evidence of his or her guilt (see, how to catch a cheating spouse).

Sadly enough, some level of suspicion might actually be warranted from time to time. Research indicates that if you want to look for deception in your own life, the best place to start is close to home. Lovers often lie about their true feelings for each other, the feelings they have for others, their level of commitment, their whereabouts... And people tend to tell their most serious and consequential lies to those they love (see, what lovers lie about and secrets lovers keep). 

At one extreme, some husbands and wives never plan on being faithful. While millions of other husbands and wives, who never intended to commit infidelity, nevertheless, still end up doing so (calculate how closely your spouse fits the profile of someone who is likely to cheat - infidelity quiz or take our cheating spouse survey). 

And to make matters more complicated, detecting deception, or infidelity, is never as easy as people think (see, detecting deception).  Not only can it be difficult to investigate a spouse, but doing so also raises a host of relational, ethical, and legal concerns - issues which are important to consider before starting to monitor a spouse (see, gps cheating spouse).  

In any case, most of the lies lovers tell go undetected because people downplay the risks that a partner would lie and most people over estimate their ability to spot their partner's lies (see, tell if a lover is lying). 

For the most part, the strategy of ""assuming the best"" works fairly well, until the day comes when it does not, and with little warning or preparation we have to confront the reality that our close relationships are not exactly what they appear to be.

Eventually, almost everyone will catch a romantic partner in a lie. Often, it amounts to uncovering nothing more than catching a spouse telling a small, white lie. And of course, sometimes it can involve something much more serious (see, my husband constantly cheats).

When deception is uncovered, even finding out the truth about a small, white lie can lead to problems such as increased suspicion and doubt. If your spouse is willing to bend the truth about something trivial, what about something that really matters?

And when something much more serious is uncovered, people have a difficult time coping with what they have learned and dealing with the fact that someone close to them has betrayed their trust (see, steps for rebuilding trust). 

It’s not so much that coming to terms with deception will solve all of the problems that people are going to encounter, but it will certainty help to reduce the stress, anxiety, and uncertainty that occurs when deception comes to light.

"c1ezw6h","I'm not saying the noob AFC stories are intentional trolls, I can't see how that would be of any interest to a troll, although I can't really put myself inside the mind of a real troll. Sure we've seen plenty of demented trolls (remember the /2x war?) but I'm mostly talking about the routine trolls with which we are too well acquainted. 

Yeah, there are far too many questions about ""how do I get that ONE girl."" I even got one question on that subject by PM tonight, I tried to give the guy some honest but blunt advice and he didn't like it one bit. Too bad for him. To some extent, I blame the wording of seddit's ""mission statement"" in the sidebar, and I've said so before. Currently it says ""Seduction and self-improvement from a male perspective."" It should probably say something more like ""A study group about Seduction and self-improvement from the perspective of Pickup Artist methodologies."" But as it is worded now, it almost encourages the one-itis posts.

And I also blame myself for this problem. I remember debating with quazzy a long time ago, he used to repeatedly post a canned comment that if you have to ask about how to get a woman, you'll never get her. I disagreed with quazzy, I said that wasn't going to help direct noobs into productive activities. So he stopped using that canned comment. But I was probably wrong about that. Still, that was back when seddit only had like 2500 subscribers, it was not the problem that it is today.

"c1ec1ve","I'll engage; though looking at your incredibly negative posts on my own and other people's comments about their own experiences, I think you are just trolling to pick an argument.

You are selectively ignoring a lot. 

I didn't tell ""Jess"" anything along the lines of ""you made Jane do..."" or ""all this is your fault.""  I stated she had a ""role"" in our breakup and had an influence on ""Jane"" that was detrimental to our marriage (she did;) and then I went on to specifically tell her what I believe her role was.  ""Jane"" is absolutely responsible for her actions and her relationships.  However, the letter was not directed at ""Jane,"" it was directed at ""Jess.""  You have minimal insight regarding what my interaction with ""Jane"" was at this time.

You also ignore that my letter was not sent out of the blue, to place responsibility for the divorce at ""Jess'"" feet.  It was a response to ""Jess"" supposed reaching out to me and letting me know she was there for both me and ""Jane,"" and her unsolicited (and dishonest) reassurance that she had never taken sides.  Maybe in your mind it is less passive-aggressive to simply ignore her letter and block ""Jess"" out of my life.  Or to respond by insulting her and tell her to stay out of my way.  I disagree.  It is more appropriate to let someone know where they stand, and why.  Especially when establishing a boundary.  But hey... whenever you are in a similar situation, handle it to your liking.

You seem to be offended at my posting of this ""personal matter"" for the world to see.  Though I understand questioning what benefit there is in doing so, or what my motivations are, I don't understand your anger or offense.  For one thing, it was not your personal experience being exposed, it was mine.  Feel free to ignore it.  For another, this is a snapshot of a moment in my life, *in the past.*  It's not current.  ""Jane's"" and my divorce was finalized a long time ago.  Whether people choose to approve or disapprove of the content of the posting doesn't change or affect any of that reality.

""Jess"" is not going to be affected by the posting...  She is absolutely anonymous and not in my life.  ""Karl"" found out about her affair a long time ago, and they are no longer a couple.  This is not vindictive.  And again, whether people choose to approve or disapprove of how she ends up being portrayed by her own letter to me and my subsequent response won't change her reality (or who she is,) or mine.

I agree with you about a couple of things.  Looking after all this time at the letter I sent ""Jess,"" I do find it somewhat whiny and self-pitying.  And very long-winded.  Another person posted that it had an undertone of being sanctimonious and judging.  Self-aggrandizing?  Maybe.  All those things ring true to me.  Those are definitely feelings I experienced and struggled with at the time.  So be it, I was in crises mode.  When my marriage broke apart, I questioned and re-examined my identity.  I'm  not going to re-edit the letter written then to try to make me look better than I am (or was.)

I posted the announcement and my interaction with ""Jess"" that followed because the divorce was one of the most painful, difficult, and significant moments in my life; and I think my experience may be relevant to others.  Those who choose to read it can decide for themselve if anything applies to their own life.  The posting is only a snapshot of one aspect of a broader and more complex experience.  It's content and context is honest, but incomplete.  There is obviously much more (both good and flawed) to ""Jess,"" ""Jane,"" and myself than is revealed.  So frankly, I take the personal compliments (and criticisms) that have been posted with a grain of salt.

"c1arod1","First of all, good for you for getting it done! I haven't read what other people critiqued in your film, but I'm going to launch into it anyways:

Rotoscoping has a stigma attached to it. It's your responsability to be aware of that and use it in a motivated and visually engaging way. Otherwise, people will look at it, say ""oh, it's just rotoscoped"" and instantly you've lost a good portion of your audience. Failure breeds success however, and you can absolutely do interesting things with rotoscoping....you just have to keep experimenting!

Also, consider the contrast between the female and male lead: one is a simple shade of blue, the other is more rendered with details...why? If there is a reason, it should make itself visually present at some point during the film. You need to establish a harmonic visual aesthetic within your film, otherwise it will feel...""amateur"". Make simple rules for yourself. To be quite honest I think your instincts with the background and musical choices were quite good and complimented each other. Your characters, however, felt very divorced from the space and aesthetic: if that was your intention, you need to allude to the fact that you are aware of this and explain your intention visually, or you will lose your audience. If it wasn't, be aware of it now and consider it for your next film!
The story itself is, dare I say, cute and fairly honest, but also I feel it has been done before. What motivates and pushes the story forward? If it's more so about the character, then you should really investigate what it is the character is doing when he is by himself. Think occrams razor: remove anything that doesn't NEED to be there, what is the minimum you need to explain the maximum? Also, how do you do this without simple becoming boring? That's what takes me the longest amount of time to work on my films.

"c18ztwk","I found that a few things helped.  First, you have to get her to open up about fantasies with coworkers or girlfriends or that guy at the gym.  Whatever she likes, get her expressing it.  And you can't force it down a path.  I once tried to get my ex-wife to talk about real people in her life, but she only wanted to talk about fantasies with celebrities.  I should not have shut that down.  Work *with* the enthusiasm that your spouse/girlfriend brings to the discussion of sex with others.  Enjoy her stories over the course of time; get her to be comfortable talking to you about sex with others.  Don't have an agenda beyond that.

Second, make opportunities.  You have to create situations that lead to temptation.  So for example, you might be supportive of her opening an account on Facebook and re-connecting with her old friends.  Old school mates, old coworkers, old lovers -- you need to surround her with options.  At one point, I was with my girlfriend over at the house of her ex-boyfriend.  I could see there was still some spark, and so I started making myself scarce -- I stopped talking except to provoke the two of them to chat with each other.  Then once they got going, I excused myself to the bathroom and just sat in there for 5 minutes, giving them alone time.  When I came out, they were on a sofa, with her legs draped over him.  ""Oh hi!"" she said when I came out.

The first time your wife/girlfriend does that, you will likely be shocked, even though you wanted it.  It'll feel like a punch to the gut, which will be weird, because even as you feel all unsure about it, you'll know you will masturbate about it later.  So keep your shit together.  Play it mellow.  Behave as if it's OK for your one-and-only to be flirting it up with other men.  You guys can do the nice lie -- pretend that it's just harmless flirting.  This version is really fun, because for couples that are not into cuckolding/hotwife stuff, they really stop when they find out what the boundaries are, but if you don't present a boundary to your significant other, you'll get to watch her blow right past decency into blatant sexuality, all while agreeing that it's just harmless flirting.  ""No baby, I know that kissing him was just harmless flirting, don't worry, I'm not jealous, you have fun.""  And then soon: ""No baby, I know that you got carried away.  I understand.  Flirting will do that sometimes.  You enjoy that, it's OK.""

(And then silently you wander off to take a shower and FAP LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER while you think of your girl cutting loose with another guy.)

Another way to take it is not to lie, but not to get too detailed either.  You don't need to explain all the rules to her -- after all, if it's really about true cuckolding, whatever SHE does IS the rules.  So just put her near temptation over &amp; over again, and when she gives in, just explain that this is how it should be.  The first time my ex-wife got hit on at the gym, I replied, ""Well, now the world makes sense, because at least other guys are starting to see what I see in you.""  And then when that blossomed into her fucking around, I said, ""Hey, this is the price to be with a beautiful, sexual woman: sex happens.  If I wasn't man enough to handle it, I wouldn't have opted in.""  It basically gives the woman full cuckolding rights, on the grounds that she's fucking hot and deserves to get away with it.  This is far more honest, but also fun.  This approach doesn't give you a chance to enjoy all the deception and illicit pleasures a woman would love pursuing -- because it's out in the open -- but it also means that things might happen right in front of you.  She might ask you to be her ""bouncer"" while she experiments with a new guy.  She might blatantly have another man over in front of you and just start fucking around as if you weren't there (and if you're truly into cuckolding, getting dismissed like that is going to make you hoooooottt).

So be supportive as she looks outside of the relationship.  If she thinks Facebook is lame, make an account and show her how fun it is.  If she is exhausted from working all day and you have the cash, offer to have her quit her job and stay at home for a while.  Don't offer it as something open-ended -- she might interpret it to mean, ""Now your life is about making babies and being a mom FOREVAR!!""  Instead, you say you think you can swing it for a short while, as a rest or vacation for her.  You suggest she indulge herself -- get her nails done, go for coffee with friends, have a party, go to the gym during the day ""because there won't be ANY after-work crowds"" (but really, you just want to get her hanging out with guys who are at the gym in the middle of the day while you're out, because then it's *really* convenient for her to bring a guy home while you're working and fuck the hell out of him right in your bed).  Give her opportunities.

Part 3 is this: fem-dom.  This is where real cuckolding flourishes.  Here, you bow down to her.  At this point, she's gone from chatting about fantasies to actually fooling around.  So now you let her know what's up.  You explain to her your fantasies, and how *she* gets to drive it -- so if she doesn't like your fantasies but suddenly has some of her own, *she gets to explore them if you like it or not* because she's going to dominate here.  You'll let her know she can go out with girls for a ""single ladies' night"" and bring home guys.  You'll tell her that while you're working, you expect her to do whatever the hell she desires, with men or women.  You bring her in on the secret, and since she's already been enjoying it for a while, she won't opt out now that she knows what's going on.  But she *will* feel empowered at this point to do whatever she wants, whether it's fulfilling your fantasies or hers.  And you better capitulate and allow her to own your ass, if you know what's good for you.",1292306688,"this is far more honest, but also fun.","honest, but also","honest","but",TRUE,"more honest , but also fun","fun","more","also",1
"c18yrir","I'm gonna repost something I wrote a long time back - i think it's hugely helpful for those seeking jobs.

I don't know if anyone has brought this up or not (lot of posts here) -- but I had good success with ""T letters"" with a T-letter you DO NOT send a resume until after you talk to them.

the way you do a t-letter. you respond to the request for resumes with this letter ( T letters do not work when you have to fill things in within their HR taleo/brass ring/sorter software however). I was trying to figure out the best way to describe how to do this, but I just found this site and it is perfect:

**T-letter**

these days you don't have much time to make a dent, and employeers are getting absolutely swamped with resumes - 400 or more for 1 position. A T letter may do a few things -- distinguish you from the crowd, and answer EXACTLY their requirements.after the T letter - they often will call you to talk and request a resume. congrats - you just got your foot in the door more than those other candidates.

Get with a recruiting agency: More and more companies are using recruiting firms as their first tier for screening, more so than the hundreds of applications that they get outside of the recruiting agency just to their company website for example. recruiting agencies often have the ear of the hiring manager, and can and will skip HR when needed. Because I was a shining star with a recruitment agency my first interview was directly with the Hiring manager and her manager - HR was cut out of the loop entirely (Which is good because honestly - HR looks for people skills and such, and often - what HR thinks is good, is detrimental to the actual hiring manager and the hiring manager gets a round of crap candidates. more and more managers know this and are using resourcing firms to fill this gap.

Research: know the company as well as the employees - and know it well enough that you can make your knowledge relevant to the position you are discussing. It's one thing to know that the company's stock is up/down - but it is a whole other thing to be able to talk with authority and comfort about a recent project that was highly public, or a methodology that you found out that the company uses.

Key Word Research: It has been said here a few times, and they are 100% correct. know the terminology in your industry. make sure you echo the words in the job posting.

**Networking:** Find someone that works there or in the field you want to be in and offer to take them out to lunch or dinner to find out more about the company or the field. put people in the position to be a type of mentor and most people will find it flattering and will help you how they can. This works on all levels, I know someone who would write presidents and CEOs and such of companies and offer them lunch to talk to them about what they are looking for in their employees, their culture etc. they would position it not as a job search (turn off to whomever you are asking) - but as a fact finding mission. Find people in the paper that are successful and ask them how they did it (don't ask for a job!!!) - if you are personable you may find your personal network growing considerably by doing these things. This one really does work, but you have to take a risk and put yourself ""out there"". Go to meetings in the area that are based on the positions you'd like to be in ""someday"" - get yourself known if you can. I know this is hard, but if you can do it - it works.

**Tailor Your Resume:**It's been said over and over here, and I'm reiterating it. slamming your resume through the email slots 100 times without tweaking the resume to fit the company and role and you just threw away 100 resumes. Resume writing/re-writing takes a lot of work, and it can get very tedious. I suggest trying to create some tweakable ""templates"" - different resumes for different company/position/environments. you still have to customize each and every one, but by doing this you keep from having to start at ""0"" every time.

**Cover Letter:** I hate cover letters HOWEVER - it has been said that if you send a resume without a cover letter or a poorly done letter, you just removed your chance at that position. The cover letter is an art that I myself have never ""gotten"". But, if you can write a good/great cover-letter you do wonders for yourself. Don't think of it as secondary - it's important, it shows your thought process, your desires, your writing style, your attention to detail, and so on and so on.

**Be nice to the receptionist!!!:** She is more often than not a gatekeeper. often, people will ask ""hey what did you think of ""applicant 1"" "" -- remember, you need to be on your game the whole time you are anywhere near the place. you have no idea who that guy behind you is getting coffee (before the interview) or who that person is in the elevator. remember this - be on your game. Those people won't get to find out you are hard working or smart - those people will find out if you are ""nice"", ""articulate"", ""witty"" -- all good things to be.

**Interview** - Be honest, but tactful: They have heard it all. they have heard that ""your greatest weakness is that you are a perfectionist"" - they have heard all of the work-arounds out there. Don't be afraid to say that you don't know BUT you would love to research it and find out. I use to ask 1 question that had NO answer (it was technically not possible). I wanted to see if someone would be willing to accept that they didn't know something, or how they would react if they DID KNOW it was technically not possible. the best candidates said ""I don't know, but i'm going to figure it out"" -- the candidate I hired - WROTE ME later that night to tell me he couldn't figure it out and how he was looking for the answer. I then told him - there wasn't one.

**Don't Doodle!!** You may be thinking and working out an idea in your head, but they see it as boredom. don't do it.

eliminate your verbalized pauses the ""well, you know"", Uhhh, umm...""like"", all the little phrases that people use to fill in the gaps when their brain hasn't caught up to their mouth. It takes work, but eliminate these from your speech if possible.

recognize when it is time to not talk When you are finished with your idea, close the idea and stop. don't be afraid of that small silence and DON'T try to fill that silence with more words. Don't interrupt them while they are speaking, but make sure you circle back on anything that they were talking about that interested you.

get them to laugh a little if you can lighten the mood a bit, so that you can try to get to a conversational level, but keep it professional EVEN if they don't. remember, they already have the job they don't need to be professional if they don't want to be.

Ask questions, but make them relevant! - I have asked lately ""how many emails a day do you receive on average?"" -- that question throws them off a bit, and gets a good conversation going (why do you want to know that - you respond with I wanted to find out more about how you communicate internally with team members, etc etc. Another good one is ""what does, in your opinion someone need to have in order to do this job successfully?"" (be prepared though - you might not ""have"" it) I've also gotten in the habit of asking at the end of the interview something like ""I'm always looking for feedback to improve my performance in an interview or when discussing my career with someone - how do you feel I did, what would you suggest I improve on?"" This usually throws them a bit, and buys you some brownie points with them.

Try to be timely. Respect their time - ask the questions you want to ask, but when it comes up to say 10 min before the hour, try to close the meeting. I say things like ""I notice that it is getting close to ""1 pm"" and I'm sure you have some preperations for a meeting (or or whatever...) and I give them a graceful way to end the interview. remember, it is expensive for them and the company to talk to you (by the time they research you, interview 2 times, and hire you - they may have spent several thousand dollars in productivity). don't waste their time.

Close the deal: End the interview with an ""action item"" ask for next steps, etc. tell them that you will be proactive and contact them back if you don't hear from them by ""xyz"".

Send a thank you note: I prefer an actual hand-written note. email will do, but if you can get them a note - it's much more memorable - get their business card with their proper spelling. I often immediately after leaving the building try to remember something ""Specific"" that the person mentioned - and jot it down on their business card. then use that specific piece of information in the thank you note. I.E. interviewer mentions weekend plans on a boat fishing blah blah blah -- thank you note says ""enjoy your boating weekend, I hear the water is going to be incredible!"" -- or whatever. personalize it.

If you don't get the position, try to find out why. don't be rude about it, but inquire politely - they may tell you, they may not, but any feedback you get is valuable for the next time.

And, after this - all I can say is keep trying. the market is rough right now. there are many many people that are very qualified who are not finding work. I was in that situation for a year and 3 months - and I got lucky, and found a great role - but, I don't have any illusions that I was special in some way - it was right place, right time. Just keep trying.

and, don't say NO. it may not be perfect, it may pay way less than you like but it gets you 2 things -- 1. experience 2. a job and #2 is critical as many companies are at the point where they are only hiring people that already have jobs (yeah...depressing I know).

Keep trying. Don't give up.

Unofficial Prospective visits are also good, just show up to a class ten minutes early, tell the instructor that you are a prospy, and ask to sit in.  You will usually get a chance to chat with students after the class, and this is valuable info.

General school interview tips:
1. know the school - research programs, particular professors, and the things that make it unique from its counterparts.

2. be honest but concise about your grades.  You don't need to go into the details of your lab partner bailing on you, but show how you were able to juggle supporting your family's business and your studies.

"c189guv","Sounds like you have two issues - her not reciprocating and her being hurt when you turn her down.

For the latter, instead of asking her ""what's wrong"" or ""why are you acting that way?"" try to explain to her what *your* problem is. 
""Sometimes when I'm stressed about school or something else, I'm just not in the mood for fooling around. It has nothing to do with you! You're always amazingly sexy - my brain is just wired to not be receptive to it when I'm too stressed or tired. But when I turn you down and it hurts your feelings I feel like a huge ass. Can we please agree that it's ok for me to feel ""not sexy"" some nights, too? Really agree, not just say that it's ok and then you go and feel mad anyway?""

"c189dt5","&gt;you submitted this Delingpole piece going on about ecofascists and watermelons—heck you used the term ""watermelons"" in the title! 

That word ""watermelons"" was Delingpole's - that title was a straight quote ([*""AGW is on its last legs. The watermelons who still talk about it and obsess about it are the equivalent of a tiny suicide rearguard that gets left behind by a losing army to cover its retreat.""*](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100065683/why-i-now-deeply-regret-my-last-post/))

I'm happy to see it had the desired effect - making you uncomfortable :)


&gt;In the body of the text, Delingpole goes on a conspiratorial rant: 

&gt;...

&gt;This is one step away from World Bank/invasion of the body snatchers conspiracy theories. The links that you submit point to vast conspiracies and then you try to deny it. That's ridiculous!

When Hugo Chavez stands up at the big conference in Copenhagen and gets a standing ovation for a bunch of anti-capitalist left-wing-nuttery - something's not right.


That being said, I don't think being ""in on the scam"" (Delingpole's words) necessarily implies a conspiracy.  Sometimes large numbers of prominent and otherwise-intelligent people can adopt some very stupid ideas and ignore conflicting information because they benefit from the idea in some way. Some off-hand examples:

- The thousands and employees and investors in Enron - a HUGE scam. Not a conspiracy.

- the many folks working for intelligence agencies around the world who thought Saddam had WMDs - an ENORMOUSLY wrong idea. Not a conspiracy.

Now these folks didn't collude to make something bad happen. But they did go along with something stupid and destructive out of simple follow-the-herd mentality.  The benefits derived ranged from simple acceptence by one's peers, to the hope increased status, to greed, to misplaced altruism, to a sense of self worth from loyalty to an ideology. 

There were a few who were in positions to know better and yet did nothing.  I think they're fair game for condemnation. 


# 
 
 
&gt;&gt; ""It's individuals and groups - namely the Greens -cluelessly adopting political philosophies""

&gt;The findings of climate science are based on the work of thousands and thousands of scientists, ...

Now you've conflated the political notions of the Greens with climate science.

You've insulted many good climate scientists.

&gt;... all of these scientists would need to be in on it together. It's crazy!



And now you've mischaracterized my position on climate science. Most of it is just fine.  Some of it has been marred by a bias towards an agenda.  Most of the *way it's reported* has been twisted beyond all recognition.

A few climate scientists (for example, a small number of them posting on the George Soros funded servers at RealClimate.org) have made the entire discipline look bad. 



# 



&gt;It isn't a specious counter-argument that the construction being attacked matches the findings of nearly every other researcher in the field. I can't even believe you'd suggest as much, it's so obviously absurd. 

You really need to read the Hockey Stick Illusion.


&gt;you're already asserted that essentially all of the other proxy reconstructions out there suffer from ""their common use of inappropriate proxies, inappropriate data analysis, lack of disclosure of data, and false claims of ""independence"".""

Another mischaracterization. I was referring to the few which you said matched the Hockey Stick - not ""all of the other proxy reconstructions"".


&gt;&gt; ""For one thing, the original Hockey Stick almost completely erased both the MWP and the LIA. Over time, other reconstructions have began to add them back in - just like  the consensus was before the Hockey Stick was published. To  say they ""matched"" - is not exactly true.""

&gt;The MBH98 reconstruction has a much more pronounced Medieval Climate Optimum than some other reconstructions, such as Esper et al.'s Low-Frequency Signals in Long Tree-Ring Chronologies for Reconstructing Past Temperature Variability and it's roughly in the middle of the pack for the larger comparisons of different reconstructions.

You may not agree with me. And you may not like the way I convey my thoughts.  I may be human and thus prone to make mistakes. 

But I've given you my honest thoughts here.

Your claim that ""I'm lying through my teeth"" is another unsupported assertion.

# 

&gt;You should know that I initially started off on the ""skeptic"" side of the debate. I've followed McIntyre, Jo Nova, Watts, Pat Michaels, Singer, the lot of them, for a long time. I've gone through painful denial misinformation, like the Great Global Warming Swindle. I've attended talks by denialists, such as Tim Ball. I started off sympathetic to the denial side of things. I then seriously studied in the field and realized that the misinformation peddled by the denial community is complete nonsense.

I find this paragraph difficult to believe. 

I've known people who drastically changed their worldview, and I've changed my own ideas on some major issues in my life.  The first and last sentences of this paragraph are not at all consistent with that.

# 


&gt;I'll follow this up with a challenge for you though (on the off chance that you're an honest but mistaken guy): contact any 20 climate researchers, chosen at random, and see if you can find evidence of this vast scam. ...

  
That's just ridiculous. For a quite a number of reasons:

For one thing, this idea that I think there are many scientists actively colluding in a scam is in your imagination only.

For another - why in the hell would I want to intrude on the time of 20 busy people to meet a challenge from some dude on the internet?


# 

&gt;&gt; ""What's dishonest is that you claim I'm denying the words in a NAS report.""

&gt;You're denying that it's a vindication of Mann et al.'s results when the summary of the findings of the NAS report match MBH98's findings nearly point for point. (There are differences on minor points, such as that Mann et al. place less confidence on data before 1400 whereas the report places less confidence on data prior to 1600, etc.)

The ""summary of the findings of the NAS report"" is not the final arbiter of physical reality.  The scientific method demands EVIDENCE - from reality.  It doesn't care about a NAS report.  It can't offer ""vindication"" except in the minds of those who accept it's words as gospel.

For a number reasons, the NAS report is not gospel.

You really need to read the HSI.


# 


&gt;Nope, you smeared those researchers when you stated that their work suffered from: ""their common use of inappropriate proxies, 

Bristlecones: Rutherford, Crowley, Esper, Jones, Moberg and OsbornBriffa06

&gt;inappropriate data analysis,

Many of those used short centered PCs, or like in the case of Esper, cherrypicked series

&gt; lack of disclosure of data,

Hergerl, D'Arrigo, Esper


&gt;and false claims of 'independence'.""

All except Moberg had involvement by members of ""the Team"" or those closely associated to team members

# 


&gt;You want some issues from Bishop Hill? ... Montford states that McIntyre: ""showed that the appearance of the [hockey stick] graph was due solely to the use of an estimate of historic temperatures based on tree rings from bristlecone pines, a species that was known to be problematic for this kind of reconstruction""

&gt;The hockey stick appears even in the borehole data: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/pollack.html 

The Mann99 Hockey Stick graph goes back to 1000AD. Your borehole graph goes back to 1500.  Huang published another paper in 97 showing a MWP even warmer than the 20th century.


&gt;if you take out the tree ring data from the MBH98 data set, you get the same shape back to 1750 (prior to which he didn't have non-dendro data): http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/ei/ei_nodendro.html

Mann didn't *choose* to use non-dendro data prior to 1750. It existed.


&gt;He later updated this with more recent non-dendro data that goes back farther: http://www.realclimate.org/images/M08.jpg


It uses Tiljander - UPSIDE DOWN.  

That's the funny thing about the Hockey Team - they make this claim that it doesn't require Bristlecones, but they leave Tiljander in.  And then they'll claim that it doesn't require Tiljander, but they'll leave Bristlecones in. If they'd remove them both - the MWP and LIA come right back and the original Hockey Stick can no longer be seen.



&gt;Anyhow, it would take a lot of space to rebut all of the issues on there and I'm pretty much done with this.

Don't feel bad.  Nobody else can find much wrong with the HSI either.

"c164mnn","The method I'm most in favor of is: when a ""news"" organization does something like this, all the other news outlets call them on it, and all the sponsors drop that organization for a while (1-3 months, minimum); at the same time, the public stops viewing that program until they make both a retraction and correction, plus a public apology on their own station and others in the same geographic markets.

This keeps the government out of the censorship business, and it hits the offenders [Murdoch] really hard where it hurts the most: their pocketbook.

Calling a show ""commentary"" should not indemnify them against this - using the public airwaves to deliberately misinform the public is not hard to recognize, and once a show gets hit with it a couple times, (or in Beck &amp; O'Reilly's cases a few dozen) they will realize that there is a huge monetary cost to pursuing that, as well as a large drop in their viewership - destroying their ability to distribute propaganda.

Here are the rules i broke according the list: 
 
 
1) Don't Stare at Men or Talk Too Much- we talked for 13 hrs straight the first date and that is when we started to fall in love

2) Don't Meet Him Halfway or Go Dutch on a Date- we alternate out of a sense of equality...my choice...we are partners

3) Don't Call Him &amp; Rarely Return His Calls- we talk a few times a day and always have
Always End Phone Calls and dates First

4) Don't Accept a Saturday Night Date after 3:00PM- its a mutual thing don't want to be bitchy

5) Fill Up Your Time before the Date- usually want to veg and primp or get my stuff done before a date not be crammed  

6) Stop Dating Him if He Doesn't Buy You a Romantic Gift for Your Birthday or Valentine's Day- my SO is super sweet but I know that if i have my heart set on something (romantic date for a special day or a gift etc) I should let him know- he cannot read my mind

7) Don’t See Him More than Once or Twice a Week- started 2-3 times and gradually went up to living together over 6 mos

8) No More than Casual Kissing on the First Date- fell asleep together but no nookie on first date.... felt right

9) Don't Rush into Sex, Wait at Least Three Dates- waited 2...but spent about 20 hrs together in those 2 dates :) 

10) Don't Tell Him What to Do- I am alpha and tye A so we talk through things 

11) Let Him Take the Lead-we share the lead

12) Don't Expect a Man to Change or Try to Change Him- we change each other- because we bring out the best in each other...but i don't want or need him to change to love him


13) Don’t Open Up Too Fast- we opened up date one- but neither of us dumped emotional baggage on the other
14) Be Honest but Mysterious- NOPE just myself, honest but dorky

15) Don’t Live with a Man (or Leave Your Things in His Apartment)- Just moved in and couldn't be happier in our new house!!!!

16) Slowly Involve Him in Your Family-he met 50= relatives after only a month- and liked em!


17) Don't Break The Rules!

"c13bsas","Research some of the local staffing agencies in your area. A Google search with something like ""staffing agencies in"" should reveal some in your area. You might have to check out their website a bit and see if they have anything relating to your field. Also, if there is a local company that you want to work for, give them a call and ask if they use a temp agency... if they do, ask which one and get in contact with them.

When you meet with the agency, prep like a normal interview. Look your best, bring copies of resume, and brush up on your industry's lingo and technical stuff. You might even have to take a test (excel, word, industry-specific program, etc.) to assess your skills so that the agency knows you will be capable on a given assignment.

When they ask you questions regarding how far you're willing to commute and salary requirements, be honest but flexible. You might want to shoot a bit lower than your ""ideal"" salary. Why? What if your dream job comes along paying $18.50 but you tell the agency you won't go lower then $20/hr? Plus, it'll give you a better idea of how actively your recruiter is searching for you with more options available.

Some of the main perks:

- well... it's typically free.

- it's another person job searching for you (working with an agency shouldn't mean you stop looking for full-time positions)

- it can lead to a full time position (company A is more likely to hire someone they know and work with daily than joe blow who emailed his resume to a hiring manager)

- build your experience while still searching for full-time employment

- often, you won't even have to interview with the company you're on assignment for

I'm currently temping and was told on Friday by my manager that they'll probably hire me full-time. Tomorrow will be my third week on this assignment.

2. I'm crushingly honest, but kind. For example, for me, if you are divorced or have kids, it's probably going to be a dealbreaker. I also tell them that if a woman being like the girls on torrid.com or igigi.com is a dealbreaker, they shouldn't contact me either.

3. Answer a *lot* of questions. Seriously, it's worth it. And fun, once you meet someone, to see what you disagree on.

4. You will get a lot of loonies. It happens, especially to the ladies. A lot of ""lol, ur smart and stuff wanna have sexytimes with me?"" just ignore them, do not feed the trolls.

5. Post a flattering but honest pic of yourself. If you don't have one, invest a little time in asking a friend to take one, don't just put up a crap group shot you've cropped yourself out of. I have like four face pics, and one of the whole me. That being said, most of the guys I've dated have said I was way better looking than my pics.

6. If you're up for long distance, it obviously increases your pool by several orders of magnitude. Consider it. I've had some awesome relationships from all over the country, and all over the world (yeah, I travel a lot). 

7. Exchange a lot of emails before you meet, get to know each other before you agree to go on a date. This doesn't always work, you can always go on a date on a lark, but it helps filter out some of the committed crazies.

8. If you aren't interested (I got about 50 messages a day sometimes) send back a polite no thanks (as long as they're not trolling). They will greatly appreciate it. I have a sort of form letter. If they start getting aggressive, block them.

9. Have fun, but remember it is work to find a relationship that works. You're a grown-up and hopefully have good sense. It will help guide you to a lot of great relationships.

I sort of ended up being the OkC mini-matchmaker somehow. I've introduced three people to the site, and all three of them have found their future spouses on it. :D The only one of my friends who haven't had good luck using it are ones that don't make an honest effort on their profile or responding to messages.

What if, once you started working and so on, you donated two nets a week, for example? Call it ~100 per year. Pay goes up a bit or when otherwise you can afford it you do four nets per week. 200/year. That would start to add up and probably count as a difference, no?

Also, you can get into the microlending thing (Kiva, etc...). From what I hear that sort of thing does well, plus the same chunk of money often can be used over and over to help more people.

But also, consider that lots of people are focused on various aid to Africa things, right? So perhaps you might want to look for other things, things that may be important but somewhat neglected (comparatively).

&gt; I'll be honest and say that donating money seems to be a by pass method of helping people - not because money doesn't help, but because well how many companies have been exposed as using numerous funds for their own benefit instead of the cause they were founded for? I would rather be out there in the field doing something.

Well then, you have to simply look into the organizations, see if they seem to be dishonest in how they use donations or not, right? (or did I misunderstand your point?)

Yes, there're ""charitable"" organizations that turn out to not be so much. And others that are good. And some that may be honest, but non-optimal, etc... Hence having to look into it a bit, see which have a good reputation or otherwise seem unlikely to be a scam, and so on. And if it's a project/etc that already is huge, that has tons of donors and people working on it, then maybe select something else that seems a bit more neglected but still important. (ie, you want to do as much good/dollar as possible. (Although you don't want to spend so much time/effort searching for the optimal that you skip on the good you could have been doing in the meantime))

The point is, you can do good. Potentially even have a comparatively large impact in the long term.

&gt; but I see that I can't save the world either...if that was my purpose and I can't accomplish that then I""m just a waste of space and oxygen.

Maybe not on your own, but if you look at the biggest things the world needs saving from, and then go down the list to find the major things that it seems only a few people are touching, that would be a very good place to start, right? Maybe you can't do it all on your own, but you might be able to still do much worthwhile good that almost no one else is doing (or otherwise gives most benefit per dollar/effort/whatever.) So the key point is: You can do good. If you try to reason it out rationally, to think where the most leverage is, you may even be able to do far more good than most people who want to do good but don't really think it through.

Oh, out of curiosity,

&gt; There is A LOT that can be done for the big problems of the world with a little effort but the bureaucracy of the world doesn't allow that.

"c0zjz01","There are many pros and cons to this development. 

Some people argue that it's a bad thing, because the freedom of choice is taken away, because the freedom of religion is taken away, because it would be a racist law, because it was made with the sole intention of pestering muslims, because the french where being dicks when colonizing half the world 100 years ago so they shouldn’t be crying now, or whatever.

Some people argue that it's a good thing because women are oppressed by being forced to wear a burqa, because muslims are being dicks about their religious rights even though they break most of them daily, because it is not according to the french culture to cover your face, or whatever.

Most of these arguments hold some truth in them (mostly the arguments against this law, to be honest) but still I support this development. Why? Because covering your face is not an accepted form of appearance in a western society. Women living in France wearing burqa’s are therefore not complying to the accepted values of the society they’re living in.

Let me explain the above by telling you how a society works. I’m no sociologist by all means, but still I think I have a valid point. In a society, people are free to do whatever they want to, as long as they keep themselves within a certain bubble that contains the accepted values of that society. Some people don’t want to be a part of this society or values and would like to withdraw themselves from it. It’s their right to do so. It's their right to stay home for the rest of their lives, it's their right to buy a piece of land and never interact with society again. But as long as you openly move yourself amongst people who are in a society with certain values, you have to comply with their bubble of standards. That’s why I don’t piss on the streets, don’t run around naked and don’t kiss every girl I like, even though I’d like to do all of that quite often.

This is why in most muslim societies, women will be covering their hair. In most buddhist societies, people will not be showing the soles of their feet to others. In most western societies, you’re an equal individual and you’re able to communicate openly and on the same level with everyone you meet.

If it's for asking directions, buying something in a store or chitchatting about the weather, it's plain COMMON COURTESY to be able to look someone in the face. That's why telephone conversations are not the same as talking to someone in the face. That's why you don't look the other way when talking face to face. That's why you're a dickhead when you keep on your sunglasses when talking to someone (!) It's a simple but honest form of communication that's embedded in our society: look someone in the face to see what they mean, what they want and what they're feeling. Whether they're smiling, crying or looking like they've been dead for 4 days, they're able to communicate just by showing their face.

The latter is made completely impossible by wearing clothes that cover your face. I have no problem with people wanting that, and i'm sure as hell not going to tell anybody to adapt to our society's rules. But if you choose so, move to a place where you don’t interact with this society. Stay home for the rest of your life, buy a piece of land and never leave it, or best of all: move to a place where your values are accepted. Wherever you go, make sure it’s a place with people whose value-bubble accepts your values or a place without people.

This is exactly why I would not show my feet to a Buddhist, or would make my girl cover her hair in a muslim country. I find it interesting that our values differ and I am more than happy to adjust myself to theirs (and their society’s) if I’m there. If I don’t want to do so, or if their values seem repulsive to me, I stay the fuck out of that place. 

This is why I support this French law. Either adapt to bubble of western values or move to a society that accepts your behaviour. A lot of things are accepted in our western society bubble. It is a diverse place where you can be different from others, where you have freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to do whatever the fuck you want to do. But adapt to the local values or stay out, because you sure ain't going to form your own bubble inside ours and create some strange colliding atmosphere in our society. I would never want to do that to someone elses society out of respect and I demand the same respect from people in other societies. I think this law is the good right of a society that draws a line between what's accepted and what's not.

TLDR; being able to see someone’s face is a common value of western society. If you’re not willing to comply with that, don’t interact with our society and stay home, move to a lonely piece of land or find a society that does comply with your values. Please read the above before making a judgement.

2. I'm crushingly honest, but kind. For example, for me, if you are divorced or have kids, it's probably going to be a dealbreaker. I also tell them that if a woman being like the girls on torrid.com or igigi.com is a dealbreaker, they shouldn't contact me either.

3. Answer a *lot* of questions. Seriously, it's worth it. And fun, once you meet someone, to see what you disagree on.

4. You will get a lot of loonies. It happens, especially to the ladies. A lot of ""lol, ur smart and stuff wanna have sexytimes with me?"" just ignore them, do not feed the trolls.

5. Post a flattering but honest pic of yourself. If you don't have one, invest a little time in asking a friend to take one, don't just put up a crap group shot you've cropped yourself out of. I have like four face pics, and one of the whole me. That being said, most of the guys I've dated have said I was way better looking than my pics.

6. If you're up for long distance, it obviously increases your pool by several orders of magnitude. Consider it. I've had some awesome relationships from all over the country, and all over the world (yeah, I travel a lot). My long-term bf is from Scotland.

7. Exchange a lot of emails before you meet, get to know each other before you agree to go on a date. This doesn't always work, you can always go on a date on a lark, but it helps filter out some of the committed crazies.

8. If you aren't interested (I got about 50 messages a day sometimes) send back a polite no thanks (as long as they're not trolling). They will greatly appreciate it. I have a sort of form letter. If they start getting aggressive, block them.

9. Have fun, but remember it is work to find a relationship that works. You're a grown-up and hopefully have good sense. It will help guide you to a lot of great relationships.

This is huge. Far too often, a person sees disagreement as an opportunity to beat down their opponent by proving them wrong. In a culture that values intelligence, winning an argument is a means of signalling that you're high-status. My problem with having a culture that holds up intellectualism *as such* is that you get a lot of people who aren't actually concerned with truth and wisdom, but rather, *looking* wise in order to be esteemed by their friends, community, etc. These are the people who do as you say, ""beating down"" their opponents.

"c0w98jo","I was a student but my scholarship didn't pay for food. I figured if I couldn't find a job, I wouldn't be able to continue living at college more than a few months, but that I did have enough money to start a business. I had been repairing computers for people off and on for 10 years (I'm 20 so that's a long time for me) so I decided I would start a computer repair business. 

I figured I would be able to beat the competition on both price and quality, and would make up for lack of advertising with social networking. I got a friend in on the deal, leased some cheap commercial space, bought a domain name, put up a website, quit college, filed a Assumed Business Name with the state and a Business License with the city, bought some minimal equipment, set up a business account with my credit union and I was all set. 

Or so I thought. Business was dismal. I learned that people in this town aren't very social, so you either have to be very well connected or very well advertised. I had my share of connections, but my social network covered the surrounding rural area where I had lived, it didn't really extend into the city. Even though I kept a low overhead (&lt;$800/mo operating expenses) I never could make any profit. I just couldn't get enough customers to come. It didn't help that my friend lacked expertise and was not as willing to learn as he said he would be. By the end I had sold many of my posessions just to keep the lights on. I could have sold my truck and kept going for another 2 or 3 months, but I decided I'd had enough.  Now I live in the sticks with my mom and sister, unable to find a real job. Ironically it seems I've been getting more ""freelance"" work now than I did those months. Its not over, its a new beginning.



TL;DR: Tried hard and failed, but it could have been worse. Know your network. Competition doesn't have to be good, or cheap to drown you out, just loud. Be cautious when involving friends in business. Advertise. If you can't afford to advertise, don't get into ""real"" business. Shield yourself from your business debt, if possible. Be honest, but shrewd.
ABOVE ALL: Try something. If you don't succeed, oh well. Go out and learn the things they don't teach you in school *the hard way*.

"c0tgyan","Ugh, a couple of my friends tried Match and had the same experience you did - nothing meaningful, the ""matches"" were no better than what you described.

Here's my advice for making it work:

*What worked for me:*

1. My profile is kinda long, but broken up into easy-to-read bits.

2. I'm crushingly honest, but kind. For example, for me, if you are divorced or have kids, it's probably going to be a dealbreaker. I also tell them that if a woman being like the girls on torrid.com or igigi.com is a dealbreaker, they shouldn't contact me either.

3. Answer a *lot* of questions. Seriously, it's worth it. And fun, once you meet someone, to see what you disagree on.

4. You will get a lot of loonies. It happens, especially to the ladies. A lot of ""lol, ur smart and stuff wanna have sexytimes with me?"" just ignore them, do not feed the trolls.

5. Post a flattering but honest pic of yourself. If you don't have one, invest a little time in asking a friend to take one, don't just put up a crap group shot you've cropped yourself out of. I have like four face pics, and one of the whole me. That being said, most of the guys I've dated have said I was way better looking than my pics.

6. If you're up for long distance, it obviously increases your pool by several orders of magnitude. Consider it. I've had some awesome relationships from all over the country, and all over the world (yeah, I travel a lot). My long-term bf is from Scotland.

7. Exchange a lot of emails before you meet, get to know each other before you agree to go on a date. This doesn't always work, you can always go on a date on a lark, but it helps filter out some of the committed crazies.

8. If you aren't interested (I got about 50 messages a day sometimes) send back a polite no thanks (as long as they're not trolling). They will greatly appreciate it. I have a sort of form letter. If they start getting aggressive, block them.

9. Have fun, but remember it is work to find a relationship that works. You're a grown-up and hopefully have good sense. It will help guide you to a lot of great relationships.

"c0t2bf2","I don't know if anyone has brought this up or not (lot of posts here) -- but I had good success with ""T letters""    with a T-letter you DO NOT send a resume until after you talk to them.  

the way you do a t-letter.  you respond to the request for resumes with this letter ( T letters do not work when you have to fill things in within their HR taleo/brass ring/sorter software however).
I was trying to figure out the best way to describe how to do this, but I just found this site and it is perfect:

[T-letter](http://www.techwr-l.com/articles/employment/tletter)

these days you don't have much time to make a dent, and employeers are getting absolutely swamped with resumes - 400 or more for 1 position.   A T letter may do a few things -- distinguish you from the crowd, and answer EXACTLY their requirements.after the T letter - they often will call you to talk and request a resume.  congrats - you just got your foot in the door more than those other candidates.


**Get with a recruiting agency:**  More and more companies are using recruiting firms as their first tier for screening, more so than the hundreds of applications that they get outside of the recruiting agency just to their company website for example.  recruiting agencies often have the ear of the hiring manager, and can and will skip HR when needed.   Because I was a shining star with a recruitment agency my first interview was directly with the Hiring manager and her manager - HR was cut out of the loop entirely (Which is good because honestly - HR looks for people skills and such, and often - what HR thinks is good, is detrimental to the actual hiring manager and the hiring manager gets a round of crap candidates.   more and more managers know this and are using resourcing firms to fill this gap.  


**Research:**  know the company as well as the employees - and know it well enough that you can make your knowledge relevant to the position you are discussing.   It's one thing to know that the company's stock is up/down - but it is a whole other thing to be able to talk with authority and comfort about a recent project that was highly public, or a methodology that you found out that the company uses.  


**Key Word Research:**   It has been said here a few times, and they are 100% correct.  know the terminology in your industry.  make sure you echo the words in the job posting.  


**Networking:**  Find someone that works there or in the field you want to be in and offer to take them out to lunch or dinner to find out more about the company or the field.  put people in the position to be a type of mentor and most people will find it flattering and will help you how they can.   This works on all levels, I know someone who would write presidents and CEOs and such of companies and offer them lunch to talk to them about what they are looking for in their employees, their culture etc.  they would position it not as a job search (turn off to whomever you are asking) - but as a fact finding mission.   Find people in the paper that are successful and ask them how they did it (don't ask for a job!!!) - if you are personable you may find your personal network growing considerably by doing these things.  This one really does work, but you have to take a risk and put yourself ""out there"".   Go to meetings in the area that are based on the positions you'd like to be in ""someday"" -  get yourself known if you can.   I know this is hard, but if you can do it - it works.


**Tailor your resume:**   It's been said over and over here, and I'm reiterating it.  slamming your resume through the email slots 100 times without tweaking the resume to fit the company and role and you just threw away 100 resumes.   Resume writing/re-writing takes a lot of work, and it can get very tedious.   I suggest trying to create some tweakable ""templates"" - different resumes for different company/position/environments.  you still have to customize each and every one, but by doing this you keep from having to start at ""0"" every time.


**Cover Letter:**   I hate cover letters HOWEVER - it has been said that if you send a resume without a cover letter or a poorly done letter, you just removed your chance at that position.  The cover letter is an art that I myself have never ""gotten"".   But, if you can write a good/great cover-letter you do wonders for yourself.  Don't think of it as secondary - it's important, it shows your thought process, your desires, your writing style, your attention to detail, and so on and so on.        


**Be nice to the receptionist!!!:**   She is more often than not a gatekeeper.   often, people will ask ""hey what did you think of ""applicant 1"" ""  -- remember, you need to be on your game the whole time you are anywhere near the place.  you have no idea who that guy behind you is getting coffee (before the interview) or who that person is in the elevator.  remember this - be on your game.   Those people won't get to find out you are hard working or smart - those people will find out if you are ""nice"", ""articulate"", ""witty"" -- all good things to be.


**Interview - Be honest, but tactful:**   They have heard it all.  they have heard that ""your greatest weakness is that you are a perfectionist""  - they have heard all of the work-arounds out there.   Don't be afraid to say that you don't know BUT you would love to research it and find out.   I use to ask 1 question that had NO answer (it was technically not possible).   I wanted to see if someone would be willing to accept that they didn't know something, or how they would react if they DID KNOW it was technically not possible.  the best candidates said ""I don't know, but i'm going to figure it out"" -- the candidate I hired - WROTE ME later that night to tell me he couldn't figure it out and how he was looking for the answer.   I then told him - there wasn't one.   

**Don't Doodle!!** You may be thinking and working out an idea in your head, but they see it as boredom.   don't do it.

**eliminate your verbalized pauses**  the ""well, you know"",  Uhhh, umm...""like"",  all the little phrases that people use to fill in the gaps when their brain hasn't caught up to their mouth.  It takes work, but eliminate these from your speech if possible.   

**recognize when it is time to not talk** When you are finished with your idea, close the idea and stop.   don't be afraid of that small silence and DON'T try to fill that silence with more words.   Don't interrupt them while they are speaking, but make sure you circle back on anything that they were talking about that interested you.   


**get them to laugh a little if you can** lighten the mood a bit, so that you can try to get to a conversational level, but keep it professional EVEN if they don't.  remember, they already have the job they don't need to be professional if they don't want to be.   

**Ask questions, but make them relevant!**  - I have asked lately ""how many emails a day do you receive on average?""  -- that question throws them off a bit, and gets a good conversation going (why do you want to know that - you respond with I wanted to find out more about how you communicate internally with team members, etc etc.  Another good one is ""what does, in your opinion someone need to have in order to do this job successfully?"" (be prepared though - you might not ""have"" it)  I've also gotten in the habit of asking at the end of the interview something like ""I'm always looking for feedback to improve my performance in an interview or when discussing my career with someone - how do you feel I did, what would you suggest I improve on?""   This usually throws them a bit, and buys you some brownie points with them.

**Try to be timely.**   Respect their time - ask the questions you want to ask, but when it comes up to say 10 min before the hour, try to close the meeting.   I say things like ""I notice that it is getting close to ""1 pm"" and I'm sure you have some preperations for a meeting (or or whatever...) and I give them a graceful way to end the interview.  remember, it is expensive for them and the company to talk to you (by the time they research you, interview 2 times, and hire you - they may have spent several thousand dollars in productivity).  don't waste their time.        

**Close the deal:**   End the interview with an ""action item""  ask for next steps, etc.  tell them that you will be proactive and contact them back if you don't hear from them by ""xyz"".   


**Send a thank you note:**   I prefer an actual hand-written note.  email will do, but if you can get them a note - it's much more memorable - get their business card with their proper spelling.   I often immediately after leaving the building try to remember something ""Specific"" that the person mentioned - and jot it down on their business card.  then use that specific piece of information in the thank you note.  I.E.  interviewer mentions weekend plans on a boat fishing blah blah blah -- thank you note says ""enjoy your boating weekend, I hear the water is going to be incredible!"" -- or whatever.   personalize it.  

**If you don't get the position, try to find out why.**  don't be rude about it, but inquire politely - they may tell you, they may not, but any feedback you get is valuable for the next time.



And, after this - all I can say is keep trying.  the market is rough right now.  there are many many people that are very qualified who are not finding work.  I was in that situation for a year and 3 months - and I got lucky, and found a great role - but, I don't have any illusions that I was special in some way - it was right place, right time.  Just keep trying. 

and, **don't say NO.**   it may not be perfect, it may pay way less than you like but it gets you 2 things -- 1.  experience   2.  a job    and #2 is critical as many companies are at the point where they are only hiring people that already have jobs (yeah...depressing I know).

Keep trying.  Don't give up.

"c0t0w0v","It's a fallacy to say that people who can't afford health care are lazy and just want to mooch off a system. Can you really afford health care on a Starbucks wage? You make $6/hour, most of that goes to rent and groceries, what do you have left to pay for health coverage? What if you worked for a little mom and pop grocery store that didn't offer health coverage? Starbucks only employs so many people.

Then suppose you get hit with a devastating disease. You can't work anymore, your workplace fires you since you've used up all your sick leave and still can't come back to work, and you haven't been able to afford to buy health insurance on your $6/hr wage. What do you do? (I actually don't know, do you still get care and you're just totally bankrupted and ruined with your credit destroyed for the rest of your life? Or do you not even get care?)

I could be hard-working, honest, but poor, and I could still get screwed by the system. Suppose you lost your job. Suppose you weren't able to get another job with health benefits. Suppose whatever job you did get pays barely enough for you to afford housing and food, let alone health premiums. Then suppose you got sick. Suppose that even with health insurance the care you need isn't covered. You've done everything humanly possible to go about things the right and honest and hard-working way, and you still get screwed.

It's not about being a crybaby, it's about addressing human suffering, and the human right to a reasonable quality of life.

Creating a public health system would create a large bureaucracy to manage the system, but the truth is **the US health system already has a gigantic bureaucracy** in place. The health insurance companies are already between you and your doctor, spending a chunk of your premiums on employees to evaluate claims validity and to figure out who to reject based on ""pre-existing conditions"", forcing your doctor to spend a chunk of his income/time/energy on managing the billing and claims with the insurance companies.

In the end, you ignore the central point in the article and in many other cross-national health care surveys. Fundamentally, the US pays more per person for health care, and ending up with lower scores in metrics for positive health-outcomes. 

What if you could pay less and you could get care as good as you get now, if not better?

"c0sbu6t","From personal experience, I'd guess that the main problem for you could be that you're just not sure how to proceed.  My advice:

(1) Go on a dating site.  Put up a good pic of yourself, make an honest but entertaining profile, message girls with short, maybe a touch witty messages containing something relevant to their profile.  Check out [OkCupid's Blog](http://blog.okcupid.com/) for ideas.

(2) If a girl responds, exchange a few more messages; don't be over eager, don't come off too clingy and don't get hung up on a single girl (statistics aren't in your favour).  If all's going well, within a week offer to go for a beer/tea/coffee after work.  

(3) Have a good time on the date.  If more follow, feel free to get physical with her if she looks like she might be interested.  

(4) If it works, great, you might get a gf (and might even cease to be a virgin)!  If not, now you've got some experience.  Chances are, you won't see this girl again, so don't worry about making too many mistakes.  Start with (1) again, now with a better idea of how to proceed.

Feel free to ask advice of any friends who have/had bfs/gfs, they'd probably be glad to offer it.  Advice from female friends would be especially useful.  Also, it's OK to tell a girl you're with that you've no experience -- it happens to others too, and she might even think that it's cute; if she was willing to have sex with you before you mention this, it's almost guaranteed that she'll be still willing after as well.

"c0rzpok","I'm going to echo some parts of some other posts on this page, but it's the most important part, so it needs to be said again. 

A few things:

---We are talking about a tool. A method. A means, if you will, to capturing images. The ""best"" paintbrush. As you've discovered, your decision can't be qualified entirely by specifications. It's an art, not a science. Cliché, but true. Not that photography is directly analogous to the construction industry, but when it all comes down to it, which circular saw has the highest rpm isn't necessarily as important to some people as where the grip is placed, how the trigger feels, or where the cord is placed to stay out of your way. 

My personal opinion? I borrowed/played around on/got to know my father's Nikon D70. It instantly felt familiar in my hand, despite not knowing how to use it. The shutter release button was satisfying. The menu and control buttons seemed to be placed where they ""should be"" to me. If I get a Canon in my hand now (I've used mostly the stuff you would be looking at, like T2i, T1i, XSi, XTi) (I shoot a Nikon D90 now, and shot a D5000 before), it feels like a toy to me. Let me remind you, before we go any further, that this is all my honest, but totally subjective opinion. It only matters to me, and I'm only providing it so you can see what some of my quips are, and what you should look for in your preferred system. 

The shutter release feels like shit, the placement of the power switch seems unintuitive, and while I actually think that Canon designed a nice interface on a number of their cameras, interacting effectively with this interface proved frustrating. The button-presses felt cheap, and quite honestly, shitty, like I would press them and there would not be enough of a resounding ""click"" for me to know whether I pressed them or not. My left thumb always ended up hanging out on the back LCD screen, obscuring it/messing it up. Again, specs aside, this is basically me going ""BMW is better than Audi, because the shift lever is better positioned to my hand"". It matters only insomuch as you do this process for yourself, and determine feels good to YOU. 

---You are buying into a system, and you should be mindful of this, but not let it rule your decision. As you get further into photography, you will begin to discover what you like to shoot. There are certain things that you will just make you go ""Yes. That is IT."" For me, I love photojournalism/documentary stuff, I love shooting at night in the absence of light, and I like shooting some candid, close, portraiture. As a result of these things, I mostly shoot with fixed-focal length lenses with great low-light capabilities that can't zoom, called primes. 

Now, why this matters. Nikon has some nice, somewhat affordable primes that I like and that I was also able to get my hands on for a steal. The 35mm f1.8, the 50mm f1.4 (and the 50mm f1.8, all of this will matter more to you later), and the 28mm f2.8 mostly. As a result, I don't really give a shit about Nikon's supposedly fabulous pro-level zooms. I'll never use really have an occasion to use them. People will be like Nikon's/Canon's/Pentax's/Sony's blah blah XXmm f1.whatever is AMAZING. This doesn't really matter if you can't afford it or would have no interest in its uses. Nikon has a great, sharp 70-300mm telezoom that's good and sharp for things like nature photography. I don't shoot nature, so this would/should not sway me into either camp.

Most redditors that shoot Canon will tell you that Canon has some great affordable primes as well, and probably lots of other things that I'm not sure of. Many people swear by Canon's line of ""L"" glass, but that shouldn't really mean anything to you if you aren't into either system yet and don't know how far you'll go down the rabbit hole you'll go. I'm not as familiar with Canon lenses (for obvious reasons, I bought into the Nikon system), but I would love if some other redditors could chime in with some good affordable lenses, and what they are good for, like the 50mm f1.8 ""nifty fifty"" that everyone raves about. 

Also, if you disregard all my previous advice, I would at least recommend looking at buying a used/refurbished body. Bodies - as another poster already said - stay useful and do not necessarily retain their value, so buying new doesn't help you much if you can find a quality used unit. You could get a lot more bang for your $ (assuming you're in the US, sorry if you're not, haha) buying a used D70/D80 on the Nikon side or a used T1i (people are practically giving those away since the T2i came out) on the Canon side. Buying a slightly higher than entry level allows you to grow in a bit, and avoid some of the frustrations you'll run into as you mature as a photographer, like a user interface that treats you like a 4-year-old. Really, if you read a lot (I read and still read a TON) and shoot a LOT, you will mature quickly. 

Anyway, sorry for writing you a novel, and I hope you can extract a modicum of use from it :). Good luck, and keep asking questions.",1276402109,"let me remind you, before we go any further, that this is all my honest, but totally subjective opinion.","honest, but totally","honest","but",TRUE,"honest , but totally subjective","subjective",NA,"totally",1

"c0rljl4","Hey, I have to say I *love* OkC. I've met tons of awesome guys on it, and have made some lasting friendships.

*What worked for me:*

1. My profile is kinda long, but broken up into easy-to-read bits.

2. I'm crushingly honest, but kind. For example, for me, if you are divorced or have kids, it's probably going to be a dealbreaker. I also tell them that if a woman being like the girls on torrid.com or igigi.com is a dealbreaker, they shouldn't contact me either.

3. Answer a *lot* of questions. Seriously, it's worth it. And fun, once you meet someone, to see what you disagree on.

4. You will get a lot of loonies. It happens, especially to the ladies. A lot of ""lol, ur smart and stuff wanna have sexytimes with me?"" just ignore them, do not feed the trolls.

5. Post a flattering but honest pic of yourself. If you don't have one, invest a little time in asking a friend to take one, don't just put up a crap group shot you've cropped yourself out of. I have like four face pics, and one of the whole me. That being said, most of the guys I've dated have said I was way better looking than my pics.

6. If you're up for long distance, it obviously increases your pool by several orders of magnitude. Consider it. I've had some awesome relationships from all over the country, and all over the world (yeah, I travel a lot). My long-term bf is from Scotland.

7. Exchange a lot of emails before you meet, get to know each other before you agree to go on a date. This doesn't always work, you can always go on a date on a lark, but it helps filter out some of the committed crazies.

8. If you aren't interested (I got about 50 messages a day sometimes) send back a polite no thanks (as long as they're not trolling). They will greatly appreciate it. I have a sort of form letter. If they start getting aggressive, block them.

9. Have fun, but remember it is work to find a relationship that works. You're a grown-up and hopefully have good sense. It will help guide you to a lot of great relationships.

"c0reb4h","&gt; A lot of people heard she was ""apparently"" really liberal with the banhammer.

This is true, but all I meant by that was that I had never *personally* been banned by her.  Apart from that what experiences I had with her did not leave a particularly glowing impression.

In particular I had seen several posters complaining about (and linking to posts) where they were being reasonable and still getting banned, or politely appealing and complaining about being banned and basically being told to fuck off, or debates where the other person was being reasonable and polite and she was being completely unreasonable and rude, and even using her mod-powers to threaten them over completely un-ban-worthy disputes.

What little *direct personal* experience I had indicated someone who was heavily involved in reddit and the community, but who also had a temper, too little reflectiveness and who was prone to over-reacting or acting rashly when annoyed.  She also seemed cheerfully unconcerned about hypocrisy - bitching people out for offensiveness even while being offensive herself and the like.

To be fair those are personality traits that are common in many people... but that doesn't make them admirable, and with additional mod powers comes additional responsibility to be reasonable and not abuse them for personal reasons.

&gt; Then after the first few attacks she was backed into a corner and she fucked up.

True, but it's an open question whether her actions were ""an honest but stupid fuck-up"" or ""further disingenuity and back-sliding in an attempt to preserve her position in the community"".

To be fair, moderating a high-traffic subreddit given her profession was unarguably a conflict of interest.

Someone of unimpeachable integrity would have politely refused the offer of moderatorship.  Someone of reasonable integrity would at least have been careful how they acted and who they banned, given their own professional status and the possibility of perceptions of hypocrisy.

Thanks to her attitude and behaviour Saydrah was a controversial figure at *best*, there were plenty of people who seemed to have quite legitimate grievances with her moderating choices, then all the stuff about her job came out, and *then* instead of doing the decent thing and resigning as a mod on principle, she started screaming ""sexism"" and throwing as much mud as she could to distract from the issue in the hope some would stick.

She even posted a thinly-veiled headline on 2XC baselessly claiming sexism in an obviously manipulative attempt to get them to rally behind her... however, 2XC saw straight through it and basically told her where to go for her presumption.  And this is *after*, remember, videos surfaced of her basically touting her position in the reddit community on her CV, and doing a video interview about how it was important to develop a good reputation on social news sites in order to advertise your content better.  Again not damning, but highly suggestive and not a little skeezy.

As I said, I have no problem with her personally, but I think her behaviour at the time was highly instructive, and pretending the whole thing was motivated primarily (let alone *only*) by personality conflicts is to misrepresent the issue and do the reddit community a gross disservice.

There were legitimate grievances with her attitude, behaviour, hypocrisy and debatable (ab?)use of moderation powers *as well as* a lot of people who simply didn't like her for personal reasons.",1275659762,"true, but it's an open question whether her actions were ""an honest but stupid fuck-up"" or ""further disingenuity and back-sliding in an attempt to preserve her position in the community"".","honest but stupid","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but stupid","stupid",NA,NA,1

"c0oy485","Re: distrust of ""smart people."" 

George Orwell wrote how some ideas are so foolish that only an intellectual could believe them (full quote at the bottom of my reply). ""Anti-intellectualism"" can be rather poorly defined -- and can often be an *ad hominem* attack (e.g., commonboarder's reply). Often, the line of reasoning that intellectuals (or their supporters) use to support their arguments is like this: ""I'm intelligent and/or have an advanced degree, therefore my idea is valid. You are a plebeian, and therefore incapable of understanding my brilliance."" The flaws and arrogance in this line of reasoning should be obvious. 

There are often damned good reasons to distrust intellectuals -- in fact, economist Thomas Sowell wrote an excellent book on the subject: *Intellectuals and Society* (2009). Sowell notes, for example, that intellectuals are typically divorced from testing and/or implementation of their ideas -- intellectuals are rarely forced to deal with outside verification of their claims, and are rarely called to task, in any meaningful way, for their errors. 

Bertrand Russell, for example, is still widely regarded as a foremost philosopher and pacifist of the 20th century. But in celebrating Russell's rosy optimism, people forget that he was urging total disarmament of England *at the very same time that Hitler was re-arming Germany*. Russell (and many other leading intellectuals of the 1920s and '30s) thought that if England dismantled her armies and destroyed her weapons, neither Germany or any other nation would *dare* attack a country that had taken the moral high ground towards worldwide peace. This illogical and naive reasoning strikes me as the way characters in Loony Tunes shorts expected to avoid a bully: ""You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, wouldya?""

Another good reason to distrust intellectuals is the strong influence of Marxism in the humanities departments of Anglo-American universities. Marxism is an idea that *seems* fair and honest. But it simply doesn't work -- historian Richard Pipes notes that the core principles of Marxism ""fly in the face of reality"" and were disproved *during* and shortly after Marx's lifetime. Yet generations of intellectuals have convinced themselves that Marxism is valid, despite its having failed miserably everyplace it was attempted. It's entirely possible for a college student to earn a humanities doctorate without ever being exposed to a critique of Marxism, or understanding why capitalism has succeeded so brilliantly and improved the quality of life for millions while Marxism has led -- without exception -- to brutality and totalitarianism. Yet Marxist professors of art or literature somehow feel justified in making grand pronouncements about economics and other fields of study well beyond their expertise. 

Sowell also notes that America was founded and built largely by individualists and pragmatists. These people were impressed by *tangible results*, not by fancy talk. This same spirit of skepticism remains powerful in America, with good cause. A religious preacher, professor and reporter can *all* try to use confusing verbiage and intellectual bullying to pull the wool over my eyes. But understanding a bit of logic, the scientific method, and expecting people to *prove* their ideas has protected me from uncritically accepting a lot of bullshit. 

In one of his books or essays (can't find the exact source; sorry) John Taylor Gatto writes how most modern American teachers would be eaten alive if forced to defend their ideas by the Socratic Method. Most teachers, he notes, are not trained in logic. And most teachers are handed their curriculum as though it were gospel truth -- any deviation from the lesson plan is cause for excommunication from the Intelligentsia.

"c0ot0hv","&gt;I'm going to take the first step; It's taken me a few years to gain the courage, but I think I can get the medical help I need

This is great winter; it's a huge step for you to come this far.  But, you're unfairly saddled with guilt over the very real nature of your situation.


I believe you, and I understand you.  But think carefully about your feelings, while considering that any of the following may be true:

1) Your parents may have never experienced what you are going through right now, and therefore might not fully understand

2) Your parents may not have been around other people who are going through what you are going through right now.  

3) Mental health professionals may have a better understanding of your pain, and the path to a place, where you can again get joy and happiness out of the simple things in life. 

&gt;Somehow it's easier to tell the truth under the covers. Maybe I'll give it a shot if she ever asks ""what's wrong"" again. 

When you say this, it sounds to me like you're waiting for your Mom to magically understand something that she might not understand... and once she understands, *then* you'll feel okay telling her.  The problem is that the way to get someone to understand where you're at, is to honestly talk to them about where you're at.  You want your mom to understand something that you refuse to honestly describe to her.  You're asking for magic, unless you **start honestly talking about your suicidal thoughts and feelings!**

&gt;I'd hate to hurt her or my father. I just know I'd start crying and I never cry.

In these two sentences, are two honest, but different ideas that you have to separate.  Yes, it's true that you would hate to hurt your mother and father.  I think that's part of the reason why you have been trying so hard to get better.  

&gt; I just know I'd start crying and I never cry.

Yeah, you'll probably start crying.  Man up; and cry.  In this second sentence, you admit that you're ashamed to show weakness.  The fact that you're talking about your Mom indicates that you're more ready to talk to her.  Right now, you're fear of showing weakness to your parents is very close to beating the fear of hurting your parents.  You know, and we know, that your parents would much rather see you cry and live, then not cry and die.  You know this.  We know this.  We all know that you're afraid to admit the reality of where you're at.  And frankly, we all know that this is a very hard thing to do.  But this is what you've gotta do.  

Being honest with your parents doesn't mean you've failed.  Being honest with your parents means that you're growing up.  You don't have to live in fear of their judgment (which is probably something more in your head then it is in theirs anyway).  Instead, you're taking steps into real adulthood.  And adulthood in this sense is making no apologies for who you are, while still accepting control over your own destiny.  Being a healthy adult means that you live in fear of **no one's judgement**.  Rather, you know who you are, and you're the opposite of weak when you know you're in a bad place and that you need a hand.  Sometimes, it may seem like weakness to certain people who haven't been tested like you have been tested, but you already know things about the scope of human emotions that they don't.  Now is the time for you to be a bigger man. 

Winter; when you can talk to your Mom, honestly, and without fear, about your suicidal thoughts, this isn't weakness.  When you can be honest, and reach out, and connect, **this is strength**.  When you can do something you **want to do** but are **afraid to do**, how is doing this thing weakness?  You know that this takes strength.  You know that this takes courage.  And you know that this is the first step for taking control over your life, and your own brain/emotions, as an adult, instead of getting kicked around by fear.  

You have a lot of heavy shit that you need to fight, and secrecy is enemy #1.  Ask for a needed helping hand, and fight it like a man. 

In the meantime, pm me, or anyone else who has been trying to help, anytime, about anything.  ",1272182305,"in these two sentences, are two honest, but different ideas that you have to separate.","honest, but different","honest","but",TRUE,"honest , but different","different",NA,NA,1
"c0orego","TL;DR The whole situation sucks and the way to fix it is immigration reform

I am living in Arizona. While I am white, my wife is a very dark skinned woman who is a fifth generation American of Hispanic descent. My children have brown hair and brown eyes. Thank goodness they got their mom's looks, cause I am fugly. 

I don't think some Redditors can understand the HUGE problem that illegal immigration really is in this area. We get not just poor people looking to better themselves, although that is the majority. We also get drug smugglers, human smugglers, sex offenders, murderers, and every other type of criminal you can imagine fleeing Mexican justice by crossing in to the U.S.  thus making crimes committed by illegals a significant problem.

Checkpoints like this are wrong and should be abolished, or at least established at the border and not on the highway miles inside the border, however the Mexican government doesn't cooperate with the program and encourages their citizens to cross the border illegally. Cash being sent from America to Mexico is one of the largest sources of income in Mexico, second only to their oil production.

Ideally I think that getting in to this country legally shouldn't take tens of thousands of dollars and years of legal paperwork. A background check to purchase a hand gun takes about thirty minutes. The same could be done at the border and a photo ID with a thumbprint issued to cross over and work here. And it should go both ways, with U.S. citizens being allowed to cross over and work or visit with the same type of check. That would make the poor people looking for work have no reason to risk death in the desert or being held captive by coyotes (the human smugglers who trade in misery.)

Then it should be an automatic felony with a mandatory five year minimum sentence to be caught in this country illegally. The judge could have the option of suspending the sentence on the first offense and deporting the illegal so that our prisons wouldn't fill up, but the second offense would carry the minimum five years with the suspended five years tacked on the end. This would discourage honest but desperate people trying to make a quick buck by carrying over a few kilos of cocaine and would keep the murderous scum looking to flee Mexican justice off our streets.

The Arizona law sucks, but the alternative is to do nothing like the federal government has done. We are frustrated and living in a war zone. The law isn't as stupid as people are reporting. It makes being in the country illegally the equivalent of misdemeanor trespassing and obligates an officer who finds out someone is illegal while they are under arrest for something else to turn them in to immigration. They won't be able to stop someone for being Hispanic, nor will they be throwing citizens on a bus headed south because they left their driver's license at home while they were taking a walk. Both sides of the issue are being belligerent about this law and refuse to see that the other side has legitimate concerns. I am only hopeful that cooler heads will prevail.

What if NASA wanted to send a vessel out into space that would never come back, but would just keep going and going and sending back messages of what they'd found? And, for arguments sake, this vessel HAD to be manned to avoid collisions with planets/provide a commentary of what was being seen.

Let's say hypothetically the ship had a shitload of fuel and was very powerful, moreso than any ship they have today, and that it was incredibly easy to operate- it didn't need a highly trained astronaut to fly it. A member of the public could do it.

Let's also say there's room for only 1 person, and they'd have to know and accept that this ship would not be coming back- they would die somewhere in outer space. So NASA specifies that an ideal applicant might be someone with a termal illness that was not so developed that they would die very soon into the mission, but would allow the mission to go on long enough for them to discover and see perhaps unimaginable things in our universe but not long enough that the pilot would spend years and years in isolation before they kicked the bucket. Let's also say this ship has a bed, food/water/toilet. 

And say, perhaps, that they found someone who was willing to do this, and we were all aware that somewhere in the sky above us was a little vessel with a person on board who was travelling to infinity and beyond, to their eventual death, alone on perhaps the very edges of the universe, while we were all sat here talking to each other.

It's possible that her family is *not* the cause of her ignorance -- maybe she just has no interest in the subject at all, in which case you'd better cut your feelings off because she will never be interested in sex. But IME, most of the time a traditional religious family is the cause. And even then, if she didn't figure it out for herself, she can't have that high of a sex drive. If you do have a high libido, that will be the death of the relationship.

Of course, this depends on her (and your) age. If she's 14 or 16, there's still hope, but if she's in her late 20s or older just forget it. It's sad, but you'll only frustrate yourself.

If you are the one to show her relationships and sex, you've got your work cut out for you. You will need to be patient above all else. You'll need to be direct and honest but also tactful, recognizing when she is uncomfortable and giving her plenty of space, but still pushing her just enough so that she doesn't become *too* comfortable and stop growing.

If you decide to pursue this, first you need to know how much interest she has in learning about it. If she doesn't even want to know, you shouldn't push the issue, just move on. If she is curious, you can suggest that you'd like to show her. If she seems open to the idea, ask her if you can kiss her. Make it brief. Ask her how it feels. Encourage her to examine her own feelings as you touch her shoulder or face, but take it VERY slowly and if she expresses any discomfort or uncertainty, sit back and give her space.

This will take years. She may have absorbed the idea that sex is supposed to be effortlessly perfect and pristine, that it should just happen, that there should never be any work involved -- this is a VERY difficult idea to get somebody to change. Even if you do everything right, it may not be enough.

"c0iukwn","&gt;The thing is, as a guy, he doesn't trust guys. 

He has a point.  Maybe your guy friends aren't openly angling to get in your pants, but I promise, if you offered, they'd happily sex you.  And your boyfriend knows this.  He knows this because that's how guys are.  So, there you have it - your boyfriend, who rarely gets to see you or sex you, has to sit home imagining all the fun you are having with the guys who DO get to see you and who also would like to sex you if the opportunity came.

So, understand that.  At the same time, as much as I sympathize with his feelings, I sympathize with yours too.  You can't spend time with him like you want to, so what are you supposed to do, be a hermit in your dorm room?  No, you're young and you need to be out socializing and connecting and making friends.  And you're doing this right - you're telling the guys about your boyfriend from the beginning, and you're being open and honest with your boyfriend about everything.

I guess all I can say is, be aware that it's painful.  Continue to be honest, but, don't gush about how much fun you are having or how great a certain guy friend is.  Be matter-of-fact about anything you say to him about your guy friends, because anything more than telling him the basic facts, will feel like you're rubbing it in his face.

And, on top of that, take calls from him in the middle of video games with your buddies, and load in a healthy dose of ""I love you baby, I miss you"" when he knows that these guys are there listening.  For that matter, see if there isn't some casual, non-forced way to get him in contact with these guys.  If he's included in your friendships with him, even in very small ways, that can help calm his worries, too.

But the fact of the matter is, this is going to suck, no matter what you do and no matter what he does.  Just make the most of it and be sympathetic to his feelings.

I apologize for not elaborating on my point. You say one thing, *I heard another*. I'm trying to make you understand that.

I feel your exercise of rhetoric is disingenuous, and the language you used to express your evidence (evidence which is anecdotal at best) to be heavily offensive.

Why should her efforts to find a support system futile? I support the idea because even honest, good men have difficulties understanding everything there is about women, so women need to stick together on online gaming communities. *Men stick together on online gaming communities, so why can't women?* Saying ""it's futile"" is perhaps more offensive than saying ""quit while you're ahead"" because you're trying to be nice about it and *failing*.

Of course I tell other people that my sex life is wonderful, it's the only thing that I do for the sole purpose of being ""manly.""  In reality, the sex is really the only thing about my relationship that's not so great. Over 3 years with my girlfriend, but she has so many hangups with herself now that she doesn't really enjoy sex anymore (though when we started it was fucking hot!).

That lack of interest or even a shred of enthusiasm makes it feel clinical and too...

She's not big into blowjobs, so that sucks (pun intended), I have to initiate every time (unless saying ""if you want sex we'll have to do it before midnight, because I've got to get some sleep tonight"" is considered initiating sex), we haven't had sex with the lights on in over a year, and there are certain positions we can't do because we're both too chubby to pull them off properly.

"c0haeld","Dingdingding!  We have a winner.

Even worse, it doesn't have to even be deliberate... and even now likely isn't.

What they do is put a draconian filtering system in place to filter out ""unambiguously evil"" content like child porn, and then later on that mechanism is inherited by later governments, who have their own ideas about what's considered ban-worthy.

Successive governments only encroach on freedom *a tiny bit* from the previous government, but every time someone complains you get people shouting down dissenters on the grounds ""it's only a trivial change, so why are you getting so bent out of shape about it?"", or (as in this case) ""Yeah, but X is evil - how can you *not* want X filtered out?"".

The other key thing here is that it's a [ratchet effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect).  No government - short of massive upheaval like a revolution or regime-change - is going to ease off on the filtering, because firstly there's no political capital in doing so, and secondly it would make them look soft on terrorism/paedophilia/whatever.

So you have a mechanism where controls ratchet ever-tighter, it's practically impossible to ever loosen them short of a major social upheaval, each step is such a tiny one that people [can't emotionally appreciate the importance of resisting it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normalcy), and anyone who *does* resist is easily dismissed as reacting disproportionately, or being actively in favour of terrorists, or paedophilia, or whatever the excuse *du jour* is for ""just tightening restrictions a little bit, just this once"".

Importantly, and this can't be said enough, **this doesn't even require a Machiavellian conspiracy or a particularly authoritarian government behind it** - it can happen simply by lots of honest but short-sighted people of good conscience just doing what they think is for the greatest good... but if allowed to run unchecked (and as previously indicated, it's *hard* to check it without looking like a lunatic or conspiracy theorist) it still ends up in a restrictive, authoritarian police state in the end.

This is exactly why it's so vitally important to *never, ever* grant *any* additional powers to *any* government unless they're *absolutely unarguably* necessary, and even then grant them for a limited span of time, and *never, ever* renew them unless there's a *proven* requirement to do so (ie, never renew because it's the default position to keep the law on the books).

Plenty of people instinctively recognise themes and trends like these, but a common cognitive illusion called an [overactive sense of external agency](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20\(External%20Agency\).PDF) (PDF warning) causes them to mistake simple but counter-intuitive [emergent behaviour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) for a conscious, intentional conspiracy.

"c0g3z9x","My wife is filipino, and I'm a white guy American. I'm Athiest and she is not. My wife is not a mail order bride, but we did talk online for many years then I went over and met her and now we are married. You could say I married my best friend. We decided to marry after my 2nd trip there. 

Over 80% are catholic in that country, or religious. Most of the catholic women I have met there are open minded though, its mostly just due to religious pressures that they claim they are catholic. 

The philippines is very poor, and often its the great thing to have an american. So women are just out for that , but not all.  Often they get bad treatment there (beatup , etc) by men. My wife says its well known that to them, American men are less likely to beat them (because we have laws against it in the usa) and that word gets around that American guys treat their filipina wives very well

They are very old fashioned, you will see most filipina women wearing pants, even though its 100F outside, for a lot of them its too ""daring"" to wear shorts or dress sexy (sexy clothes for them is the average clothes for our women here)

They believe in old fashioned values, the women believe they are to cook, clean, and take care of their husbands. They all like and want children as well. They expect the husband to work, and provide for them, and take care of them.  You can hate that if you like, but once you visit you see its part of a system. When they grow up poor this is the way it works for them to survive. 

Everyone here will tell you how bad or terrible it is , but don't listen to them. You need to visit the philippines in person, and don't jump on the first beautiful girl that talks to you, and trust me, their will be lots of them.

When you walk around there, its like being a rock star,  but while that sounds fun, it makes it difficult to find a person whom you really connect with.  Problem is in person lots of women will probably just agree with you , it might be difficult to find someone who is real and honest but they are there. 

And your social phobias would all change there , its a very uplifting country. Its not like it is here, its an amazing experience and you should not pass up the opportunity to go.

Also stop taking those meds far before you go, you don't need them. You will realize this

&gt; Has anyone read enough of this book to explain what exactly it means for all the rich people to go on strike? 

It wasn't all the rich people; it was just the creative ones.  Even within the businessmen, there were those depicted as evil (e.g. James Taggert, Orren Boyle), and those depicted as good (e.g. Dagny Taggert, Hank Rearden, John Galt).  The evil ones were those who manipulated government to give themselves an unfair advantage over their competitors.  The good ones were those who created inventions, built infrastructure, and sold new products and services.  There was also a third group of honest, but unremarkable people who sold products they've always sold or otherwise carried on traditions.

&gt; Who mops their floors? Who raises their food? Are we really supposed to believe the uber-wealthy would rather work in the field all day than pay a little more taxes?

The main character, Dagny Taggert, goes from Vice-President of the country's largest railroad, to John Galt's maid.  And it wasn't like she didn't have any choice.  So yes, that's what they do.  Paying taxes wasn't really dealt with at all.  It focuses more on nationalization, quotas, and legal oligopoly.

&gt; What exactly are they doing with their money if they're not either spending it or investing it? And most importantly, what's preventing everyone else from just taking all their stuff?

They didn't have much money by the end.  They had all invested their money into their businesses, which they then lost in one way or another.  Most were nationalized outright.  Rearden lost his company when his competitor got the government to enact quotas freezing them at their present market share and then got them to break his patent so that he could supply the government with the superior product Rearden had invented.  Dagny didn't seem to have any share of her company at all (her brother, James, owned it).  One character was slowly sabotaging his endeavors so that they wouldn't be of any value once government seized them.

&gt; Does anyone know if the book even touches on the bazillion reasons that a Galtian strike would be impossible?

When a study was found to be influenced by bias, it's later torn apart in peer review.

Honest bias, such as Connie Sonne had on a recent JREF challenge should not be favored over actual unbiased science of her failing the challenge. She was unconvinced by these 'experts' and she ignored her own failure. This is exactly the same type of mindset anti-vaccination movement people, creationists, alternative medicine proponents, etc. have.

People who spent years studying in their field, who have studied the experiments of others, and who know the general consensus of knowledge in their field, _should_ generally be given much greater weight by laymen than some honest but ignorant person. But only when speaking of things within their field. If you think a scientist is lying to you because of bias, ask a few of them. Or read some of the results of peer-reviewed studies yourself.

"c0b3xi5","Just a note: I'm an optimist. I'm an atheist. I don't see any problem with this. Ms. Marilyn McCord Adams, I believe, makes a honest but bad flaw in her argument.

Her assertion, if I've heard it correctly, is that if one is an optimist you *must* also believe in God. Because with all of the horrible things that people have done, and man's inability to fix the basic problems of suffering, only the belief in a divine being who will provide a heavenly state to make it all even in the long run is a reasonable conclusion.

Granted, I don't believe that. First of all, I disagree with her assertion that humankind has not gotten better at solving the problem of suffering. Are we 100% perfect? No. But, in general, most civilizations admit that slavery is wrong. Many, not all, believe in equal rights for women, religious and ethnic minorities. Look at how many countries provide universal health care for their citizens - a number that was nearly zero a few hundred years ago. Now, some of the most atheistic societies provide for their citizens in ways that should make most Christians happy (at least, the ones who believe in what Jesus actually said about helping the poor, the sick, and the needy).

The world is certainly far better than we were 2000 years ago. And I'm confident, no, I am *optimistic* that human progress - technologically, morally, and politcally - will conquer more and more of these problems. And I hope to do what small part I can to make this world a better place.

So I reject Ms. Adams assertion that I *need* to believe in some divine being to be an optimist in the face of human suffering and cruelty. Humanity is full of cruelty and evil, but I also see it full of nobility and hope. And, to be blunt (and this will prevent me from ever attaining political office in the United State), I believe the sooner humankind throws off their bronze age religious beliefs in favor of science and reason, the better off we'll be. Because either we can wallow in the horrors of human existence, and hope that some supreme being will make it up to use with an eternity of happiness - or we can go out and actually fix the problems out there so that our children, and their children, can someday inherit the world that we all aspire to.",1247684320,"marilyn mccord adams, i believe, makes a honest but bad flaw in her argument.","honest but bad","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but bad","bad",NA,NA,1

You are seriously jumping to conclusions here. You're going from ""My husband thinks someone is attractive"" to ""the trust is totally broken"" in like, 3 steps, which is ridiculous.

If your wife is *that* insecure, then that is totally *her* problem that she needs to work on. If she can't handle something as small as you thinking that someone else is attractive then she has some huge issues that need to be dealt with, and keeping the truth from her is only making it worse by indulging her issues.

""*Shouldn't this be allowed? Should her husband be required to force her to overcome her flaw by repeatedly hurting her*""

No, it shouldn't occur. As I just said, the husband would be indulging his wife's ridiculous insecurities. Is that to say that he should say ""oh, get over it!"" and blow her off? Absolutely not. But it is something that needs to be dealt with and by treating her like a child and lying to her, he is enabling her. If she asks him if he thinks that someone is attractive, then she needs to be ready to deal with his response. If she can't, then she needs to work on that.

As I said before, if you discuss boundaries with your significant other and make sure that they are *okay* with you lying to them sometimes, then that's fine. That is an agreement that you two will have to make. But to assume that they're fine with it without ever checking is just a bad way to maintain a good relationship. Your significant other could very well assume that they are in an open and honest relationship, all the while you're lying to them. Unless you discuss that (and I don't see very many people saying ""just so you know, I'm going to lie to you sometimes.

Maybe Asians in America have such a hard time standing up for their civil liberties because it's so normal in Asian culture to be racist, especially towards other Asians.

"c09858q","Well, to take a fairly arbitrary example, there's Dawkins' discussion of abortion in the morality chapters of *The God Delusion*.  He sets out to contrast religious morality with secular alternatives like the consequentialist position, and as an example of religious morality he discusses Mother Teresa.

Now, far be it from me to embark on a general defense of Mother Teresa.  I would by no means present her as the unimpeachable moral exemplar that some people take her to be.  Her work among the Untouchables --  a caste that could expect help from pretty much no other quarter in India -- is commendable, but I'm acutely attuned to criticisms that she fetishized suffering, and in doing so, may have increased rather than alleviated the suffering of many of those she sought to help.

That said, Dawkins' misrepresents her position on abortion.  And that distortion of her view was totally needless, since his evidence of her skewed view of moral reality was drawn from her Nobel Prize acceptance speech in which she spoke of abortion as a ""great destroyer of peace"".  To Dawkins, this seemed an obvious piece of magical thinking but if he had read on he'd have realized that the argument she was making was actually much closer to the consequentialist view he advocated as an alternative to religious morality.  In essence her argument was that potential mothers who terminate their pregnancies do so at the cost of distancing themselves from the instinct to protect and nurture their offspring.  When the practice is widespread, it contributes to the general devaluation of life, ultimately making society's attitudes about violence more cavalier or casual.

Whether or not that's the case is beside the point.  I think we could all come up with potential objections to that scheme.  The point isn't that Mother Teresa was right, but rather that Dawkins' interpretation was misleading, and could easily have been corrected had he only bothered to pay closer attention to the rest of her speech.  Either he did, in which case his presentation of Mother Teresa was dishonest, or he didn't, in which case it was illegitimate.  Either way, he took a single quotation out of context and built it into a straw man, when her actual position was within the realm of what he had earlier called a legitimate ethical train of thought.

My suspicion is that his mistake was honest but illegitimate.  He doesn't actually cite the Nobel Prize speech in the footnote to that discussion.  Rather, he cites Hitchens' book *The Missionary Position*, a sustained polemic against the public veneration of Saint Teresa.  If, as appears to be the case, Dawkins simply trusted Hitchens as a reliable source for interpretation, the real issue is that he simply didn't go back to the source documents as he should have known to do.

That isn't, by the way, the only time that Dawkins relies on Hitchens' scholarship in the book -- he also draws on Hitchens' argument casting Jefferson as an atheist.  Of course, Hitchens hadn't written *God Is Not Great* at the time, but on the whole it's a little dismaying how often Dawkins relies on the other three of the ""Four Horsemen"" to make his points.

For another, more consequential example in Dawkins, his invocation of the anthropic principle to round out his argument against the probability of God is dubious.  While reading that section I wanted to understand exactly what Dawkins was talking about, so I went back to the original article to try and understand the principle better.  The heart of the argument is that we can use our own presence as observers in the universe as one of the conditions for drawing conclusions about the universe.  In other words, since we're here, we know that the universe is the sort of place that can sustain life.  If we know what conditions are necessary to sustain life (eg. stars with a structure sufficient to produce hydrogen, oxygen and carbon) then we can assume the presence of those conditions, even if we don't have direct evidence of them.  We can then plug those conditions into other calculations that might have been open to debate without the anthropic principle.

That in itself won't get you to Dawkins' argument for atheism from improbability.  What Dawkins actually employs in his argument is a more generalized form of the anthropic principle that supposes that the conditions which made life possible could have been arrived at by supposing a multiverse in which universes arise by a process of natural selection (to hell with Universal Darwinism -- now we're talking about Ontological Darwinism).  Obviously, Darwin wasn't the first to posit this multiverse scheme, and I have no particular objection to it when it's used properly.  My problem with it in this context is a) it doesn't seem to have been used properly, and especially b) Dawkins never gave a sufficient indication of the relationship of the generalized anthropic principle to the basic form of the principle.  He presents it as though the posited multiverse were a direct consequence of our having acknowledged that the presence of observers in the universe says certain things about our universe.  The reason that's a problem is it bears heavily on the question of probability.  By making the multiverse aspect of the generalized principle seem like a more or less direct consequence of the basic anthropic principle, he makes it seem *more probable* than his readers might otherwise suppose.

In that case I find it harder to plead ignorance on Dawkins' behalf.  He cited the relevant literature; presumably he's familiar enough with it to make it a major part of one of the central theses of the book.

More generally, all four of the ""New Atheist"" authors seem to have some difficulty presenting a sufficiently full picture of current events whenever they want those events to stand as examples of the horrors of religion.  Early on in Harris' *The End of Faith*, for example, Harris talks about the 1992 Gujarat riots.  His read is that the Muslims and Hindus of Gujarat simply hate one another for their religious differences; out of that hatred, some Hindus burned a train car carrying mostly Muslim passengers; and retaliation led to riots ultimately killing between 1000 and 2000 people.  I was curious, so I did a little more research.  First of all, I looked up the NY Times article Harris had cited.  It gave a decidedly less monolithic interpretation of the causes of the violence.  That sparked my interest, so I went to the Human Rights Watch report on the riots.  That's where things got really interesting.

According to [that report][1], the riots were instigated and life-saving police intervention was restricted by the ruling political party, the Bharatiya Janata, which is itself part of the sangh parivar, a Hindu nationalist movement in India.  The sangh parivar is essentially a response to the historical perception that Indian political self-determination was stultified and remains compromised by the British and Mughul colonization of India.  The goal of the sangh parivar, then, is to redress that historical imbalance by ensuring that the descendants of India's former colonial masters (identifiable by their non-native religious traditions) are marginalized from political office.

However, in discussing the Gujarat violence, Harris presents it as a spontaneous outburst of religious hatred.  He makes no mention of the historical and political context, nor of the involvement of a political party.  The notion that religion has an inherently political dimension in India because the presence of Mulsim and Christian communities on the subcontinent is perceived to be a result of political subjugation seems entirely lost on him.

It is, I contend, a variety of the same species of selective vision that afflicts their more direct criticisms of specific religious traditions.  The shallow view of a violent episode like that of the Gujarat riots allows them to hone their arguments, whereas a view that recognized the political, historical, cultural and, yes, religious complexities of the event would force them to qualify.  But those qualifications would be honest...

"c084kzu","&gt; capitalism is based on voluntary associations.

Untrue. Capitalism is as coercive as anything else. I am held hostage by a capitalist system that tries to make every accident a matter of personal responsibility. The very existence of insurance companies is evidence of this; _I_ have to be responsible for the kinds of events that are the responsibility of no-one, and thus of everyone, but only when it happens to happen to _me_; accidents can happen to anyone and everyone, so they're _everyone's_ problems, not the people they accidentally happen to (if I am injured in an earthquake, it's _my_ fault? No. It's not your fault either, it's no-one's _fault_, but it's a _problem_ for all of us, and it's our collective responsibility to help those who accidentally suffer from accidents). This extends to the accident of birth as well, including all those other things I mentioned, the structural discrimination, etc.

In an ideal world one would simply identify those and not hire them, but this isn't an ideal one and many companies make do with whatever they can, including assuming for such activities in the estimates (not too hard to figure out from the firewall logs) and overriding them with a bit of a tighter deadline.

Ditto. :)

&gt;A lot has been written about ""the male gaze"" (as if it's separate and distinct from men, which I think it is ;-)

There's two issues for me here. One is the **label** for this phenomenon, the other is the **concept** itself.

The label is inherently sexist, as much as ""policeman"" or ""mankind""; all the more so if you accept my argument above that it is as much, or even more so, perpetrated on women *by other women*. As I said, it's women who largely administer the fashion and cosmetics industries, women almost entirely who support it financially, and as I contend, women who provide much of the pressure to engage in this one-upmanship (oops, there's a word that needs improving too). 

It's blaming men as people, and maleness as a quality, for a socio-cultural ill. Since, as I've pointed out, I think women can be shown to be in no small part active participants in perpetuating the effect, marking it as a ""male"" phenomenon is shifting the blame and responsibility. 

As to the concept itself:

What if some masculinist theorists came up with a concept called ""The Female Allure"", and lamented that wherever men go, they are bombarded with sexual signals from women. This constantly affects their hormone levels, making it difficult for them to concentrate, and driving them to continually compete with each other. Men have to excel in the areas of wealth, social status, charm, and personal appearance in order to win the attention of women in general, thus victimizing all men through a campaign of sexual manipulation. If it weren't for women and their sexy ways, men would be content to be complete slackers, paying little attention to hygiene, and earning only enough to feed themselves. ""[Everything men do, they do to get laid.](http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200807/men-do-everything-they-do-in-order-get-laid-i)""

The **idea** of the ""male gaze"" is also sexist. It implies that women are weak, and their pretty little heads are unable to resist the social pressures from their peers and media imagery. That the existence of differential attractiveness between individuals means that everyone is compelled to ""play the game"", and constantly evaluate their personal worth against the artificially constructed scale imposed by society. It plays into the victim complex, and denies the active and willing role anyone subscribing to the system takes on in perpetuating it.

We, as human beings, are subject to myriad forms of critical evaluation from others as we go about our lives, and numerous pressures to be or do better if we want more for ourselves. *That's life.* How we respond to that, either in our personal and consumer choices, or *psychologically*, in terms of esteem and self-image, is up to us. While I'd love to move towards a society built on compassion, respect, tolerance and acceptance, we are naturally, biologically competitive. Those who ""win"" the mating game get to see their genes passed on with the greatest social and material advantage. The ""losers"" have diminished reproductive choice and resources available to support those offspring.

Women are in competition with  each other, and because they respond *so positively* to it (by voluntarily spending billions of dollars annually), they are bombarded with advertising to encourage them to improve their social value (appearance, social status, reproductive potential) through artificial means. 

Men are ALSO in competition with each other. They also respond positively to advertising. Why are girls in bikinis draped over $80,000 cars? Because men want to get laid, so they buy the sports car. They buy the suits. They kill themselves with stress pursuing the high-paying career and promotions. 

So to my mind, ""The Male Gaze"" is not only linguistically and conceptually sexist, it's a distorted simplification of the complex of biological and psychological drives that lead to competition for mates, status, and wealth in human society.

&gt;Someone posts some image of a beautiful woman and there are immediately 100 male posters responding with everything from ""I'd hit it"" to ""she has &lt;some slight flaw&gt;, thereby rendering her completely unfuckable.""

I'd agree that sort of thing is completely sexist. It's also honest, but much of it is simply trying to be funny, and realistically, 99% of guys who say ""I'd hit it"", know that the woman is well out of their league. However, women can be equally sexist, discussing men's careers, appearance, and social status when men aren't listening. Don't tell me they don't. We're all constantly evaluating each other.

&gt;The issue with ""the male gaze"" is that men can and do continue to turn this critical eye to actual people and lose the connection to ""average"". Average women have lumps and moles and hair, etc.

And average men aren't charming chaps in nice suits with high-paying careers and a well-appointed home and expensive car. Yet from TV and movies, we're supposed to be.

&gt;I also am aware that some studies show that an average woman spends some 6-10 hours a week on her appearance, and that's not to get the ""better than average"" guy, it's to maintain standard respectability.

I disagree with this. Women may spend that time to live up to a particular *mainstream ideal*, but it's completely optional to play that game. One can find gainful employment without it. One can meet men of relative equal desirability without it. Given that there are people of all genders and sexual preference who refuse to play the game, or create an alternative set of ideals (eg. tattoos, piercings, fashion style within certain subcultural criteria) it's possible to lead a fulfilling and satisfying life without ever wearing high-heels or getting plastic surgery or putting on eyeliner.

&gt;I think women feel this as a ""societal expectation"", not by men or by women but by both.

Right, that's why it's not ""The Male Gaze"". It's social expectation. It's internalized criticality. It's a sisyphusian challenge to get to the top of the heap, so you can hook up with the top of the other heap. But those people climbing to the top of the heap, of both genders *generally know what they're doing*. They're doing it because *the heap is meaningful to them*, and they *want* to be on top of it. They want the best possible mates to pick from, or the highest social status, and so strive to have the most to offer in order to do so. 

&gt;Frankly, I think it's a waste and never bought into it.

Awesome! As I said, it's completely optional. One gives up certain paths in life by doing so, but landing a trophy wife or marrying a doctor or lawyer is not mandatory in order to be happy.

Anyway, I think I've written another essay. I really should start blogging this stuff.

"c04f51v","Where I think we disagree is on what is fundamentally most important.  I'd say that individual freedom is critical to individual happiness, and therefore must be promoted insofar as it doesn't conflict with other societal goals.

You'd say, (please correct me if I'm wrong) that individual freedom is the primary goal and other societal goals must take a back seat to it.

I make the possibly wrong assumption that you are a U.S. citizen.  The US founding document refers to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"".  This is a pretty strong statement in favour of individual freedom.

Canada's founding document (the British North America Act of 1867) refers to the guiding principle of ""peace, order and good government"".

I think the disparity between these principles is illuminating to the present discussion.

So to answer your question, I agree that people should be able to engage in any behaviour that is peaceful and honest, but that if these goals come in conflict with the larger goals of society as a whole then they should be set aside.

"c041m71","Like many here I question Obama's integrity on foreign policy issues.

On the other hand, I think the reason he's getting a lot of support here on Reddit from the Paul camp (myself included) is for the same reason the Paul supporters were fans of Kucinich and Gravel. Namely that, almost more important than Paul's policies, was his integrity. That is the #1 thing that's wrong with Washington today. The people there don't represent our interests. They represent the corporations, and themselves. That's it.

Yes, socialism is bad. Hell, I think it's immoral! But if there's something much worse than socialism, it's the dishonest socialism we have right now. Restore honesty, and there'll be plenty of room for powerfully persuasive people like Ron Paul to convince voters to scale back the government. But it can't be done in today's corrupt system.

Now, as I said, I question Obama's integrity. I certainly would not put him in the same class of integrity as Kucinich, Paul, or Gravel, all three of whom would clearly serve the public good with honor and fervor. But Obama does at least appear to maybe have integrity and good intentions, so best as we can tell so far. My personal impression is that he might be honest but more of a compromiser (with the Washington machine and special interests) than Paul/Gravel/Kucinich. He seems like, if he's honest, he's a pragmatist who knows he can't rock the boat too much.

And whether that's ultimately good or bad, we'll see. One thing is for sure: many of us, when it comes to voting, are also pragmatists. And that's why we're interested in Obama: he seems like the best candidate with a real shot at winning. And while you have to respect guys like Paul/Kucinich/Gravel who don't compromise their ideals, that also may be part of the reason why they couldn't gain traction in the primaries.

And once you're in congress, same thing. The best defenses I've heard, for example, of Obama's vote on the patriot act renewal was that he was voting for a slightly less extreme version of it, and, pragmatically, the choice was to try to pass the slightly-tamer version versus the full-blown original. Now that's not to say voting your conscience in the Senate is bad, but let's face it, how often has Paul or Kucinich been in situations where their votes-of-conscience risked throwing a result in a worser-of-two-evils direction? Probably very rarely.

So, hey I'm not ready to fully defend Obama but I understand completely why he gets so much love here. And besides which, on the pragmatic argument again, we certainly don't want Clinton or McCain to win. I know a lot of people here have great disdain for ""lesser of two evils"" voting but the reality is that's the way our voting system works. We don't have instant runoffs, the vast vast majority believe tactical voting is important, and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and makes it such that tactical voting IS important. And as I was mentioning before with Obama's senate vote, the reality that idealists don't want to face is that making a protest vote does have consequence, you can't escape that truth. If you think getting Paul a few extra votes at the expense of potentially throwing the election, then do it (in some cases, it *is* worth it). But if you're just voting to ""go on record"" and have a clear conscience, well, the founders didn't  give us power over the government so we could make moral declarations, they wanted us to exercise that power as wisely as possible. If you voted for Nader in 2000 so you could have a clear conscience, well, I don't see how you can have a clear conscience knowing you contributed to Bush's election.

And for the record I've been a big supporter of Ron Paul financially and with my free time. But I also understand the importance of pragmatism. Ron Paul got my vote in the primaries.

* 1) Honest people stable people
* 2) Honest but deranged people
* 3) Thugs and criminals

Keep guns out of 2 and 3 as much as possible, maximize concentration of guns in hands of 1, and suddenly, random maniacs slinging firearms onto campus because a far smaller problem.",1203403488,"guns can land i nthe hands of:  * 1) honest people stable people * 2) honest but deranged people * 3) thugs and criminals  keep guns out of 2 and 3 as much as possible, maximize concentration of guns in hands of 1, and suddenly, random maniacs slinging firearms onto campus because a far smaller problem.","honest but deranged","honest","but",FALSE,"honest but deranged","deranged",NA,NA,1
"c030mgj","At first I thought you were serious, and it frightened me that someone could be so naive.

There are only two people running right now who have the potential to turn our country around. One on each ticket. Democratic Sen. Barack  Obama and Republican Rep. Ron Paul. Vote for them, and shun all the others. 

Ron Paul, in my opinion, is by far the better choice of the two.

"c02ow87","What's wrong with, say, Barack Obama?  He's an intelligent man who supports abortion and doesn't believe the stork brought him here or that God created his oldest ancestors 6000 years ago, and as far as I'm aware he's all for personal liberty and not being militarily involved in other countries.

And he seems pretty for the constitution as well, albeit not in the ridiculously literal ""This modern issue isn't mentioned in this 200+ year old document, therefore it is impossible for me to have an opinion on it"" way that Ron Paul is.

I mean, seriously, have you not seen the damage that can be done when someone is placed in charge of the world's greatest superpower who actually believes that there is a God sitting up there in the sky who created the world in 6 days?  Bush didn't exactly come out before getting elected and say ""Oh btw I'm going to involve us in a ridiculously costly war and attempt to take away all your personal liberties"", did he?  Those were just a side-effect of him being incomprehensibly moronic.  And what better test is there of moronisism (I'm aware that that's not a word) than how religious someone is?  I mean, if I came out right now and told you that I believe the tooth fairy and santa both exist, then I would be no more moronic than someone who believes that there is actually a God: we both have absolutely zero evidence for our theories, and we both possess the critical thinking abilities of a three-year-old.

"c1gh0s","Well there's the optimistic take.

&gt;My feeling is that you are misrepresenting the scale of these things due to some hidden agenda, but I don't know what that hidden agenda is.

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, my friend.

&gt;I don't understand how you can be worried about a ""boom"" in an accelerator when much larger ""boom""s happen in power stations every day. Society as a whole has certainly accepted the notion of power stations.

Molecular level explosions can be big and nasty, but sub-atomic explosions leave a much more lasting impact and can keep spreading their nasty goodness throughout the surrounding area for quite some time. And then just to add some hyperbole, there's always the remote chance that they accidentally do something really new and exciting on a scale that makes our previous modern mistakes look like the pyramid building era problems. 

When someone can create a mistake that can't be fixed in a time frame that is longer than Western Civilization as we know it has been around, it's past time to think about the long now picture around those actions. It's hard enough as a nation to make decisions that will be advantageous to us in a decade or two, and in some cases even a quarter or two down the road, but here we are talking about widening the opening of the door to the possibility of creating problems that take longer to solve then our entire civilization has been in existence.
