abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a growing field at the intersection of linguistics and computer science that attempts to automatically determine the sentiment contained in text. Sentiment can be characterized as positive or negative evaluation expressed through language. Common applications of sentiment analysis include the automatic determination of whether a review posted online (of a movie, a book, or a consumer product) is positive or negative toward the item being reviewed. Sentiment analysis is now a common tool in the repertoire of social media analysis carried out by companies, marketers, and political analysts. Research on sentiment analysis extracts information from positive and negative words in text, from the context of those words, and from the linguistic structure of the text. This brief review examines in particular the contributions that linguistic knowledge can make to the task of automatically determining sentiment.},

abstract = {We identify and validate from a large corpus constraints from conjunctions on the positive or negative semantic orientation of the conjoined adjectives. A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82{\%} accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently. Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90{\%} for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus.},
