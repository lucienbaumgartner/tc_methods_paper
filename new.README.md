# Tracing Thick Concepts Through Corpora
Our article is available at LINK.

All scripts can be found in `src/` and have to be executed in the order of the numerical prefix (see `src/README.md` for more information on the reproduction of the results).

The scripts xx--yy concern the data collection only. They do not need to be executed, unless you want to recollect the data on your own.  Please note that you will need a stable internet connection, and the runtime is considerable. Small differences in data collection are possible, due to changes in the reddit API over time.

## Data Study 1
The original data collected for Study 1 is  available upon request via email at lucien.baumgartner@philos.uzh.ch (free of charge, of course). Please note that the data is not part of this repository, though.

## Data Study 2
The data for Study 2 can be found at `input/study2.csv` or `input/study.xlsx` (identical content).

## Analyses
The analyses for Study 1 & 2 can be found at `src/xx-study-1.R` and `src/xx-study-2.R`, respectively. All plot results are available at `output/paper/`.

## Auxiliary resources
At `res/` you will find additional resources that are used in the scripts.
