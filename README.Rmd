# The Project

So far we lack the means to distinguish thick concepts from descriptive
concepts without relying on intuitions, and to measure evaluative
intensity. Using a corpus-based approach, we show that thick
adjectives and descriptive adjectives behave differently when being
combined with the terms “and” and “but”. After having shown the
validity of our approach, we show how this method can help to answer
questions in different domains of discourse: We provide empirical
data revealing that thick concepts are used differently in legal contexts
compared to everyday language.

# Study 1: Valence - Proof of Concept
## Data
The data for the first corpus study are 256’838 target structures from reddit comments (100 days; 09.02.20-19.05.20). The data was gathered using the pushhift API via R.
